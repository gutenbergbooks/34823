<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The following pages have as their central problem the
value of money. But the value of money cannot be studied
successfully as an isolated problem, and in order to reach
conclusions upon this topic, it has been necessary to consider
virtually the whole range of economic theory; the
general theory of value; the r&ocirc;le of money in economic
theory and the functions of money in economic life; the
theory of the values of stocks and bonds, of "good will,"
established trade connections, trade-marks, and other
"intangibles"; the theory of credit; the causes governing
the volume of trade, and particularly the place of speculation
in the volume of trade; the relation of "static" economic
theory to "dynamic" economic theory.</p>

<p>"Dynamic economics" is concerned with change and
readjustment in economic life. A distinctive doctrine of
the present book is that the great bulk of exchanging grows
out of dynamic change, and that speculation, in particular,
constitutes by far the major part of all trade. From this
it follows that the main work of money and credit, as instruments
of exchange, is done in the process of dynamic readjustment,
and, consequently, that the theory of money and
credit <i>must be a dynamic theory</i>. It follows, further, that a
theory like the "quantity theory of money," which rests in
the notions of "static equilibrium" and "normal adjustment,"
abstracting from the "transitional process of readjustment,"
touches the real problems of money and credit
not at all.</p>

<p>This thesis has seemed to require statistical verification,
and the effort has been made to measure the elements in
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg viii]</span>
trade, to assign proportions for retail trade and for wholesale
trade, to obtain <i>indicia</i> of the extent and variation of
speculation in securities, grain, and other things on the
organized exchanges, and to indicate something of the
extent of less organized speculation running through the
whole of business. The ratio of foreign to domestic trade
has been studied, for the years, 1890-1916.</p>

<p>The effort has also been made to determine the magnitudes
of banking transactions, and the relation of banking
transactions to the volume of trade. The conclusion has
been reached that the overwhelming bulk of banking
transactions occur in connection with speculation. The
effort has been made to interpret bank clearings, both in
New York and in the country outside, with a view to
determining quantitatively the major factors that give rise
to them.</p>

<p>In general, the inductive study would show that modern
business and banking centre about the stock market to a
much greater degree than most students have recognized.
The analysis of banking assets would go to show that the
main function of modern bank credit is in the direct or
indirect financing of corporate and unincorporated <i>industry</i>.
"Commercial paper" is no longer the chief banking asset.</p>

<p>It is not concluded from this, however, that commerce
in the ordinary sense is being robbed by modern tendencies
of its proper banking accommodation, or that the banks are
engaged in dangerous practices. On the contrary it is
maintained that the ability of the banks to aid ordinary
commerce is increased by the intimate connection of the
banks with the stock market. The thesis is advanced&mdash;though
with a recognition of the political difficulties involved&mdash;that
the Federal Reserve Banks should not be
forbidden to rediscount loans on stock exchange collateral,
if they are to perform their best services for the country.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg ix]</span></p>
<p>The quantity theory of money is examined in detail, in
various formulations, and the conclusion is reached that the
quantity theory is utterly invalid.</p>

<p>The theory of value set forth in Chapter I, and presupposed
in the positive argument of the book, is that
first set forth in an earlier book by the present writer, <i>Social
Value</i>, published in 1911. That book grew out of earlier
studies in the theory of money, in the course of which the
writer reached the conclusion that the problem of money
could not be solved until an adequate general theory of value
should be developed. The present book thus represents
investigations which run through a good many years, and
to which the major part of the past six years has been
given. On the basis of this general theory of value, and a
dynamic theory of money and exchange, our positive conclusions
regarding the value of money are reached. On the
same basis, a psychological theory of credit is developed, in
which the laws of credit are assimilated to the general laws
of value.</p>

<p>In a final section, the constructive theory of the book is
made the basis for a "reconciliation" of "statics" and
"dynamics" in economic theory&mdash;an effort to bring together
the abstract theory of price (<i>i. e.</i>, "statics") which
has hitherto chiefly busied economists, and the more realistic
studies of economic change (<i>i. e.</i> "dynamics") to which a
smaller number of economists have given their attention.
These two bodies of doctrine have hitherto had little connection,
and the science of economics has suffered as a
consequence.</p>

<p>This book was not written with the college student primarily
in mind. None the less, I incline to the view that
the book, with the exception of the chapter on "Marginal
Utility," is suitable for use as a text with juniors and seniors
in money and banking, if supplemented by some general
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg x]</span>
descriptive and historical book on the subject, and that the
whole book may very well be used with such students in
advanced courses in economic theory. I think that bankers,
brokers, and other business men who are interested in the
general problems of money, trade, speculation and credit,
will find the book of use. Naturally, however, it is my hope
that the special student of money and banking, and the
special student of economic theory will find the book of
interest. The book may interest also certain students of
philosophy and sociology, who are concerned with the
applications of philosophy and social philosophy to concrete
problems.</p>

<p>My obligations to others, running through a good many
years, are very great. With Professor E. E. Agger, I talked
over very many of the problems here discussed, in the
course of two years of close association at Columbia University,
and gained very much from his suggestions and criticisms.
Professor E. R. A. Seligman has read portions of
the manuscript, and given valuable advice. Professor H. J.
Davenport has given the first draft an exceedingly careful
reading, and his criticisms have been especially helpful.
Professor Jesse E. Pope supervised my investigations in the
quantity theory of money in 1904-5, in his seminar at the
University of Missouri, and gave me invaluable guidance in
the general theory of money and credit then. More recently,
his intimate first hand knowledge of European and
American conditions, both in agricultural credit and in
general banking, has been of great service to me. Mr. N. J.
Silberling, of the Department of Economics at Harvard
University, has been helpful in various ways, particularly
by making certain statistical investigations, to which
reference will be made in the text, at my request. Various
bankers, brokers, and others closely in touch with the subjects
here discussed have been more than generous in supplying
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg xi]</span>
needed information. Among these may be especially
mentioned Mr. Byron W. Holt, of New York, Mr. Osmund
Phillips, Editor of the <i>Annalist</i> and Financial Editor of the
<i>New York Times</i>, Messrs. L. H. Parkhurst and W. B. Donham,
of the Old Colony Trust Company in Boston, various
gentlemen in the offices of Charles Head &amp; Co., and Pearmain
and Brooks, in Boston, Mr. B. F. Smith, of the Cambridge
Trust Company, Mr. W. H. Aborn, Coffee Broker,
New York, Mr. Burton Thompson, Real Estate Broker, New
York, Mr. Jas. H. Taylor, Treasurer of the New York
Coffee Exchange, Mr. J. C. T. Merrill, Secretary of the
Chicago Board of Trade, DeCoppet and Doremus, New
York, and Mr. F. I. Kent, Vice President of the Bankers
Trust Company, New York. My greatest obligations are
to two colleagues at Harvard University. Professor F. W.
Taussig has given the manuscript very careful consideration,
from the standpoint of style as well as of doctrine, and
has discussed many problems with me in detail. Professor
O. M. W. Sprague has placed freely at my service his rich
store of practical knowledge of virtually every phase of
modern money and banking, and has read critically every
page of the manuscript. None of these gentlemen, of course,
is to be held responsible for my mistakes. I also make
grateful acknowledgment of the aid and sympathy of my
wife.</p>

<p>In the course of the discussion, frequent criticisms are
directed against the doctrines of Professors E. W. Kemmerer
and Irving Fisher, particularly the latter, as the chief
representatives of the present day formulation of the
quantity theory. Both their theories and their statistics
are fundamentally criticised. I find myself in radical dissent
on all the main theses of Professor Fisher's <i>Purchasing
Power of Money</i>, and at very many points of detail. To a
less degree, I find myself unable to concur with Professor
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg xii]</span>
Kemmerer. But I should be sorry if the reader should feel
that I fail to recognize the distinguished services which
both of these writers have performed for the scientific study
of money and banking, or should feel that dissent precludes
admiration. I acknowledge my own indebtedness to both,
not alone for the gain which comes from having an opposing
view clearly defined and ably presented, but also for much
information and many new ideas. My general doctrinal
obligations in the theory of money and credit are far too
numerous to mention in a preface. My greatest debt in
general economic theory is to Professor J. B. Clark.</p>

<h1>THE VALUE OF MONEY</h1>



<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h3>ECONOMIC VALUE</h3>


<p>The problem of the value of money is a special case of
the general problem of economic value. The present chapter
is concerned with the general theory of value, while the
rest of the book will consider the numerous peculiarities
and complications which make money a special case. The
main proof of the theory here presented is to be found in a
previous book<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> by the present writer. A number of periodical
articles by several writers which have since appeared,
in criticism or in further development of the theory, have
at various points led to shifting emphasis and clearer understanding
on the author's part, and the present exposition,
without seeking explicitly to meet many of these criticisms,
or to embody the new developments, will none the less be
different because of them. To one writer in particular,
Professor C. H. Cooley, the theory is indebted for restatement,
amplification, and important additions.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> On the
whole, however, the theory presented in this chapter is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
substantially the theory presented in the earlier book. The
theory is set forth in the present chapter with sufficient
fullness to make the present volume independent of the
earlier book.</p>

<p>Value has long been recognized as the fundamental
economic concept. There have been many and divergent
definitions of value, and many different theories as to its
origin. It is the belief of the present writer&mdash;not shared
by all his critics!&mdash;that the definition of value which follows,
and the conception of the function of value in economic
theory involved in it, conform to the actual use of the
term in the main body of economic literature. The theory
of the <i>causes</i> of value here advanced is new, but the definition
of value, and the conception of the relation of value
to wealth, to price, to exchange, and to other economic
ideas, seem to the present writer to conform to what is
implied, and often expressed, in the general usage of economists.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>
<p>It is important to separate sharply two questions: one,
the theory of the causes of value, and the other, the definition
of value, or the question of the formal and logical
aspects of the value concept. The two questions cannot
be wholly divorced, but clarity is promoted by considering
them separately. We shall take up the formal and logical
aspects of the matter first.</p>

<p>Value is the common quality of wealth. Wealth in
most of its aspects is highly heterogeneous: hay and milk,
iron and corn-land, cows and calico, human services and
gold watches, dollars and doughnuts, pig-pens and pearls&mdash;all
these things, diverse though they be in their physical
attributes, have one quality in common: Economic Value.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
By virtue of this common or generic quality, it is possible
to add wealth together to get a sum, to compare items of
wealth with one another, to see which is greater, to get
ratios of exchange between items of wealth, to speak of
one item of wealth, say a crop of wheat, as being a percentage
of another, say the land which produced it, etc. This
common quality, value, is also a <i>quantity</i>. It belongs to
that class of qualities which can be greater or less, can
mount or descend a scale, without ceasing to be the same
quality,&mdash;like heat or weight or length. Such qualities
are <i>quantities</i>. There is nothing novel in the statement
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
that a quality is also a quantity. It is implied in every
day speech. We say that a man is tall, or heavy, or that
the room is hot&mdash;qualitative statements; or we may say
exactly how tall, or how heavy, or how hot&mdash;quantitative
statements. The distinction between qualitative analysis
and quantitative analysis in chemistry implies the same
idea. Thus we may speak of a piece of wealth as having
a definite quantity of value, or say that the value of the
piece of wealth is a definite quantity. We may then work
out mathematical relations among the different quantities
of value, sums, ratios, percentages, etc.</p>

<p>Ratios of Exchange are ratios between two quantities of
value, the values of the units of the two kinds of wealth
exchanged.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> A good many economists, particularly in
their chapters on definition, have defined value as a ratio
of exchange. This is inaccurate. The ratio of exchange
presupposes <i>two</i> values, which are the terms of the ratio.
The ratio is not between milk and wheat in all their attributes.
It is between milk and wheat with respect to one
particular attribute. Compare them on the basis of weight,
or cubic contents, and you would get ratios quite different
from the ratio which actually is the ratio of exchange.
The ratio is between their values.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<img src="images/p006.png" width="640" height="314" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p>In the diagram above, something of what is to follow is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
anticipated, since the cause of value is indicated. Wheat
is shown to be exerting an influence on milk, and milk
exerts an influence on wheat. The comparative strength
of these two influences determines the ratio of exchange
between them. But these two influences are not ultimate.
The ratio of exchange is a relation, a <i>reciprocal</i> relation. It
works both ways. But behind this relativity, this scheme
of relations between values, there lie two values which are
absolute. These values rest in the pull exerted on wheat
and on milk by the human factor which is fundamental,
which in our diagram we have called the "social mind."
Values lie behind ratios of exchange, and causally determine
them. The important thing for present purposes
is merely to note that value is prior to exchange relations,
that it is an absolute quantity, and not, as many economists
have put it, purely relative. The ratio of exchange is
relative, but there must be absolutes behind relations.</p>

<p>A <i>price</i> is merely one particular kind of ratio of exchange,
namely, a ratio of exchange in which one of the terms is
the value of the money unit.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In modern life, prices are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
the chief form of ratio of exchange, but it is important
for some purposes to remember that they are not the only
form.</p>

<p>Values may simultaneously rise and fall. There may
be an increase or decrease in the sum total of values. Ratios
of exchange cannot all rise or fall. A rise in the ratio of
the value of wheat to the value of milk means a fall in
the ratio of the value of milk to the value of wheat. Both
may have fallen in absolute value, but both cannot simultaneously
rise or fall with reference to one another. This
is the truism regarding ratios of exchange which many
economists have inaccurately applied to value itself in
the doctrine that there cannot be a simultaneous rise or
fall of values. There can be a simultaneous rise or fall of
values, but not a simultaneous rise or fall of ratios of exchange.</p>

<p>There can be a general rise or fall of prices. Goods in
general, other than money, may rise in value, while money
remains constant in value. This would mean a rise in
prices. Or, money may fall in value while goods in general
are stationary in value. This would also mean a rise in
prices. In either case, more money would be given for
other goods, and the ratio between the value of the money
unit and the value of other goods would have altered
adversely to money. There are writers to whom the term,
value of money, means merely the average of prices (or
the reciprocal of the average of prices). For them, a rise in
the average of prices is, <i>ipso facto</i>, a fall in the value of
money. This view will receive repeated attention in later
chapters. The view maintained in the present book is
that the value of money is a quality of money, that quality
which money shares with other forms of wealth, which lies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
behind, and causally explains, the exchange relations into
which money enters. Every price implies <i>two</i> values, the
value of the money-unit and the value of the unit of the
good in question.</p>

<p>Value is prior to <i>exchange</i>. Value is not to be defined as
"power in exchange." Certain writers<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who see the need
of a quantitative value, which can be attributed to goods
as a quality, still cling to the notion that value is relative,
that two goods must exist before one value can exist, and
that value is "power in exchange," or "purchasing power."
The power is conceived of as something more than the fact
of exchange, and as a cause of the exchange relations, but
is, none the less, defined in terms of exchange. This position,
however, does not really advance the analysis. It is
a verbal solution of difficulties merely. To say that goods
command a price because they have power in exchange is
like saying that opium puts men to sleep because it has a
dormitive power. Physicians now recognize that this is no
solution of difficulties, that it is merely a repetition of the
problem in other words. If we wish to explain exchange,
we must seek the explanation in something anterior to
exchange. If value is to be distinguished from ratio of
exchange at all, it cannot be defined as "power in exchange."</p>

<p>To seek to confine value to exchange relations, moreover,
makes it impossible to speak of the value of such things
as the Capitol at Washington City, or the value of an entailed
estate, or of values as existing <i>between</i> exchanges.
Nor can we make the price which a good would command
at a given moment the test of its value, except in the case
of the highly organized, fluid market. Land, at forced
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
sale, notoriously often brings prices which do not correctly
express its value. Moreover, even for wheat in the grain
pit, the exchange test is valid only on the assumption
that a comparatively small amount is to be sold. If very
much is put on the market, the situation is changed, and
the value falls. In other words, if "bulls" cease to be
"bulls," and shift to the other side of the market, the very
elements which were sustaining the value of the wheat
have been weakened, and of course its value falls. "Power
in exchange" is a function of two factors, (1) value and (2)
saleability. A copper cent has high saleability, with little
value, while land has high value with little saleability.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Some things have value with no saleability at all. In a
socialistic community, where all lands, houses, tools, machines,
etc., are owned by the state, and where such "prices"
as exist are authoritatively prescribed, value and exchange
would have no necessary connection. Values would remain,
however, guiding the economic activity of the socialistic
community, directing labor now here, now there, determining
the employment of lands now in this sort of production,
now in that. Exchange is only one of the manifestations
of value. More fundamental, and more general, including
"power in exchange," but not exhausted by it, is the power
which objects of value have over the economic activities
of men. This is the fundamental function of values. The
entailed estate, which cannot be sold, still has power over
the actions of men. The care which is taken of it, the
amount of insurance which an insurance company will
write on it, etc., are manifestations and measures of its
value. The same may be said of the Capitol at Washington.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>
<p>In the fluid market, prices correctly express values.
Assuming that the money-unit is fixed in value, variations
in prices in the fluid market correctly indicate variations
in values. The great bulk of our economic theory, the
laws of supply and demand, cost of production, the capitalization
theory, etc., do assume the fluid market, and a fixed
value of the dollar.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Our economic theory is static theory,
in general, and abstracts from the time factor and from
"friction." In fact, values change first, and then, more
or less rapidly, and more or less completely, prices respond.
In the active wholesale and speculative markets, where
the overwhelming bulk of exchanging takes place, the
prices respond quickly. Static theory is thus adequate
for the explanation of these prices, for most practical purposes,
so long as the changes in prices are due to changing
values of goods, rather than to changing value of the money-unit.
Moreover, the distinction between value and price
is, in a fluid market, where the value of money is changing
slowly, often not important. In the assumption of money,
and of a fixed value of money, the absolute value concept
is already assumed. No harm is done, however, if the
economist does not explicitly refer to this, but goes on
merely talking about money-prices. Very many economic
problems indeed may be solved that way. This is why
the inadequate character of the conceptions of value as
"ratio of exchange" or "purchasing power" has not prevented
these notions from being serviceable tools in the
hands of many writers. But there are many problems for
which these conceptions are not adequate, because the
implicit assumption of a fixed value of money cannot be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
made. Among these problems is the problem of the value
of money itself, which constitutes the subject of this book.
For that problem, an absolute value concept is vital.</p>

<p>If, in our diagram above, we substitute for "social mind"
the more general expression, "human factor," we should
find that our value concept is the common property of
many writers. We should find it fitting in with the absolute
value notion of Adam Smith and of Ricardo.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The "human
factor" which <i>explains</i> the absolute value is, for them,
labor. We should find it fitting in with the "socially necessary
labor time" of Marx: the value of a bushel of wheat
is the amount of labor time which, on the <i>average</i>, is required
to produce a bushel of wheat. It is an absolute
value. It is a causal coefficient with the absolute value,
similarly explained, of the bushel of corn, in explaining
the wheat-price of corn. Our concept will fit in exactly
with the "social use-value" of Carl Knies, according to
whom the economic value of a good in society is an <i>average</i>
of its varying use-values to different individuals in the
market. This average is an absolute quantity. The absolute
values of units of two goods, thus explained, causally
fix the exchange ratio between the goods. Knies' value-theory,
it may be noticed, is explicitly modeled on that
of Marx, to whom he refers, the difference being that Knies
takes an average of individual use-values, while Marx
takes an average of individual labor-times, as the causal
explanation.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Our value concept will fit perfectly with
Professor J. B. Clark's "social marginal utility" theory
of value. Indeed, the present writer gratefully acknowledges
that the concept is Professor Clark's rather than
his own, and that all that is necessary for its explanation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
has been set forth by Professor Clark.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Professor Clark's
<i>causal</i> theory of value, his explanation of this absolute
quantity of value as a <i>sum</i> of individual marginal utilities,
we have elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> criticised as involving circular reasoning,
like all marginal utility theories, in so far as they offer
causal explanations. But his statement of the logical
character of value, of the relation of value to wealth, of
value to price, of value to exchange, of the functions of the
value concept in economic theory, and of the functions
of value in economic life,&mdash;Clark's doctrines on these
points we have accepted bodily, and in so far as the present
writer has added anything to them it has been by way of
elaboration and defence.</p>

<p>The concept of value here developed is explicitly adopted
by T. S. Adams, David Kinley, W. A. Scott, W. G. L.
Taylor, L. S. Merriam, and A. S. Johnson, among American
writers, to name no others. All of these writers would
concur in the formal and logical considerations<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> as to the
nature of value here presented, whatever differences might
appear among them as to the causal explanation of value.</p>

<p>The value concept here presented performs the same
logical functions as the "inner objective value" of Karl
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
Menger, Ludwig von Mises, and Karl Helfferich, discussed
in our chapter on "Marginal Utility," below, and is, in its
formal and logical aspects, to be identified with that notion.
It is essentially like Wieser's "public economic
value," discussed in the same chapter.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> That there should
remain critics<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> who consider the present writer a daring
innovator, who is thrusting a personal idiosyncracy in
terminology upon economic theory, is striking evidence
that men often talk about books which they have not read!
The reader who accepts, provisionally, the doctrine so
far presented, as a tool of thought which will aid us in the
further progress of the argument, may do so with the full
assurance that he is accepting a tried and tested concept,
which has seemed necessary to very many indeed of the
great masters of the science.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>So far, the writer feels himself in accord with the main
current of economic thought. When we come to a causal
explanation of the value quantity, however, earlier theories
appear unsatisfactory. The labor theory of value has
long since broken down, and has been generally abandoned.
The reasons for this will appear in the chapter on "Cost
of Production." The effort to explain value by marginal
utility, by the satisfactions which individuals derive from
the last increment consumed of a commodity, has likewise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
broken down, as will appear in the chapter on "Marginal
Utility." In general, it may be said that the effort to pick
out feeling magnitudes,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> either of pleasure or pain, in the
minds of individuals, and combine them into a social quantity,
leads to circular reasoning. Thus, the utility theory:
It is not alone the intensity of a man's marginal desire for
a good which determines his influence on the market.
If he has no money, he may desire a thing ever so intensely
without giving it value. If he is rich, a slight desire counts
for a great deal. In other words, utility, backed by <i>value</i>,
gives a commodity value. But this is to explain value
by value, which is circular. So with the theory of average
labor <i>time</i>. How shall we average labor time? The problem
is easy if we confine ourselves, say, to wheat. If one
bushel of wheat is produced with ten hours' labor, a second
with eight hours' labor and a third with six hours' labor,
the average is eight hours, and we may fix the value of the
bushel of wheat according. But suppose we wish to compare
the labor engaged in making <i>hats</i> with the labor engaged
in raising wheat. How can such labor be compared?
Hats are, in their physical aspects, incommensurable with
wheat. The one quality which they have in common,
relevant to the present interest, is <i>value</i>. Given the value
of the wheat and the value of the hats, you may compare
and average out the labor engaged in producing them.
But if value must be employed as a means of averaging
labor, it is clear that average labor can be no explanation
of value. This is not the only flaw in the labor-time theory,
but it illustrates a vice which it has in common with all
those theories which start with individual elements, and
seek to combine them into a social quantity. The whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
method of approach is wrong. It makes two abstractions,
neither of which is legitimate: first, it abstracts the individual
from his vital and organic connections with his fellows,
and then, second, it takes from the individual, thus abstracted,
only a small part, that part immediately concerned
with the consumption or production of wealth.
In this process of abstraction, very much of the explanation
of value is left out. The <i>whole</i> man, in his <i>social</i> relations,
must be taken into account before we can get an adequate
theory of value. We turn, then, to a brief discussion of
society and the individual, and to a discussion of those
individual activities and social relations which are most
significant in the explanation of economic value.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>All mental processes are in the minds of individual men.
There is no social "oversoul" which transcends individual
minds, and there is no social "consciousness" which stands
outside of and above the consciousnesses of individuals.
So much by way of emphatic concurrence with those critics
of the social value theory<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> who persist in foisting upon
the theory the notion that there is a social oversoul, or
that the "social organism" is some so far unclassified
biological specimen. To say that economic value is a
social value, the product of many minds in organic interplay,
is not to say that economic value is independent of
processes in the minds of individual men, or that it results
from any mysterious behavior of a social oversoul.</p>

<p>The human animal is born with certain innate instincts
and capacities. Human animals of different races and
different strains are in highly important points different
in their instincts and capacities. But the human animal
is not born with a <i>human mind</i>. Nor could the human
animal, apart from association with his fellows, ever develop
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a human mind. "The human mind is what happens
to the human animal in a social situation."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Of course,
without the care of adults, the infant would, in general,
promptly perish. But, more fundamental for our purposes,
is the fact that all the important stimuli which play upon
the child during his first two years, when the human mind
is being developed, are social stimuli. So true is this, that
the child's commerce with physical things runs in social
terms. The child interprets the physical objects about
him <i>personally</i>, attributes life and human attributes to
them, holds conversation with them, praises and blames
them, makes companions of them. This <i>animism</i> of the
child, so puzzling to an old-fashioned psychology, is readily
explained by social psychology. It is a social interpretation
of the universe. It follows naturally from the principle
of apperception: the interpretation of the unknown in
terms of the known; the extension of accumulated experience
to the interpretation of new experiences. The first
experiences of the human animal are social experiences.</p>

<p>In the history of human society, a similar generalization
is possible. The human <i>individual</i> is found, not in
primitive life, but late in the scale of social evolution.
Individuality is a social product. The savage is not a free,
self-conscious person, who can set himself off against the
group, and feel himself an isolated centre of power. His
life is wrapped up in the group life. In the great barbarian
states like Ancient Egypt or China, the life of the individual
was so controlled by social tradition, and innovation was
so ruthlessly crushed out that individuality had little
scope. Greece and Judea gave larger scope to individual
variation, but the individual still felt himself bound up
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
with his group, and was stoned, given hemlock, or crucified
if he challenged the existing social order too seriously.
The break-up of the Greek city states, as independent
sovereignties, and their subjection to the universal sway
of Rome, made it possible for the cultured Greek to set
himself up in opposition to the State; the coming of Christianity,
substituting personal relations with deity, for the
communal worship which had preceded it, gave the individual
a vital interest apart from the life of the group about
him, so that he could still further feel independent of his
immediate social environment. The development by the
Roman lawyers of the <i>Jus Gentium</i>, the law which is common
to all nations as distinguished from the particular
law of a given group, emphasized the doctrine of the Christian
religion and of the Stoic philosophy of a humanity
which transcends the limits of a given state,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>&mdash;a notion
which tended to free the individual from dependence on
his immediate associates. But note that in all this we have
merely a widening and multiplying of social relationships,
and that the individual gains freedom from one set of
social relationships only by coming into others. The
Christian gains freedom from his immediate surroundings
because he feels himself in communion with "angels and
archangels and all the glorious company of Heaven."
Francis Bacon could survive his degradation in the England
of his day because he could leave his "name and
memory ... to foreign nations and to the next age."</p>

<p>Bagehot, in his <i>Physics and Politics</i>, Tarde, and Baldwin,
to name no others,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> have shown how tremendously responsive
human beings are to suggestion, how wide is the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
sway of imitation in human life, how fashion, mode, custom,
etc., make and mold the individual. Cooley,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> with an
improved psychology, has amplified the analysis, tracing
the development of the individual mind in interaction
with the minds of those about him, making still clearer
the sweep and pervasiveness of social factors in framing
the very self of the individual. In what follows, I assume
the results of these investigations. They constitute the
starting point from which we set out on the quest of a theory
of economic value.</p>

<p>So much for the individual. He is a social product.
But what of society? Objective, external, constraining
and impelling forces, which are not physical, which are
seemingly not the products of the will of other individuals
with whom the individual holds converse, meet the individual
on every hand. There is the Moral Law, sacred and
majestic, which stands above him, demanding the sacrifice
of many of his impulses and desires. There is the Law,
external to him and to his fellows, in seeming, failure to
obey which may ruin his life. There is Public Opinion,
which presents itself to him as an opaque, impersonal
force, before which he must bow, and which he feels quite
powerless to change. There are Economic Values ruling
in the market place, directing industry in its changing
from one sort of production to another, bringing prosperity
to one individual and bankruptcy to another, not with
the caprice of an individual will, but with the remorseless
impersonality of wind and tide. He who conforms to them,
who anticipates their mutations, gains great wealth&mdash;but
no business man dare set his personal values against
them. There are great Institutions, Church and State
and Courts and Professions and giant Corporations and
Political Parties, and multitudinous other less formal or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
smaller institutions, which go on in continuous life, though
the men who act within them pass and change. Their
Life seems an independent life, and the individual who
tries to change their course finds that his efforts mean little
indeed, as a rule. There is a realm of Social Objectivity,
a realm of organization, activity, purpose and power, not
physical in character, not mechanical in nature, which
is set in opposition to individual will, purpose, power, and
activity. How is the individual related to this objective
social world?</p>

<p>Three main types of theory have sought to answer this
question. On the one hand, there is a type of theory,
doubtless the oldest type, a type which arises easily in a
period when social changes are slow, which sees in the objective
social world something really separate and distinct
from individual life, having a non-human origin, and deriving
its power from something other than the human
will. On the other hand, there is an extreme individualism,
which emphasizes individual separateness, which posits as
a <i>datum</i> the individuality which we have seen to be a social
product, and thinks of the objective social realm as a mere
mechanical, mathematical summing up of individual factors,
or as a something which individuals have consciously
made, by contract or agreement, or what not. Finally,
there is a type of theory, to which the present writer would
adhere, which finds a false antithesis in the contrast thus
sharply made between society and individual, which holds
that the individual is not, in his psychological activity,
so much set off from the activities of his fellows as the
contrast would indicate, but rather shares in the give and
take of a larger mental life. This larger mental life is completely
accounted for when all the individuals are completely
accounted for, but it cannot be accounted for by
considering the individuals <i>separately</i>. No individual is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
completely, or primarily, accounted for until his <i>relations</i>
to the rest of the group are analyzed. Thinkers who start
out with the individuals separately conceived, and then
seek to combine them in some arithmetical way, abstract
from those organic social relations which constitute the
very heart of the phenomenon we are seeking to explain.
The parts are in the whole, but the whole is not the <i>sum</i>
of the parts. The relationships are not arithmetical, additive,
mechanical, but are vital and organic. Men's minds
<i>function</i> together, in an organic unity.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The first two of these types of theory (perhaps because
individuals are <i>physically</i> sharply marked off from one
another, and go on in <i>biological</i> functioning in obvious
separateness) have falsely accentuated the self-dependence
and separateness of individual <i>minds</i>. The second type
of theory, which has sought to work out the whole thing
on the basis of this false conception of the individual, has
largely failed to see the objective social realities, or has,
with methodological rigor, denied their existence. This
second type of thinking has especially characterized a good
deal of economic theory, which rests on the philosophy
and psychology of David Hume.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> We will set our doctrine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
in clearer light if we contrast three parallel types of theory
which have appeared with reference to the nature of morality,
of law, and of economic value. For each of these
phenomena, we have theories which represent all three of
the types of social thinking to which we have referred.</p>

<p>In the theory of morals, we have, at one extreme, doctrines
like those of Kant and Fichte, according to whom
morality is a matter of obligation, independent of the
human will, independent of consequences, inherent in the
nature of things. Man's mind can find out what the moral
law is, but man's mind has nothing to do with the making
of the moral law. The same notion is involved in the ideas
of "natural rights," "justice though the heavens fall,"
and the like. The conception is strikingly brought out
in the question about which old theologians sometimes
debated: is Right right because God enjoins it, or does
God enjoin Right because it is Right? Whether or not
Right is supreme over God, these old theologians never
questioned that Right is supreme over all human wishes
and desires, and in no sense an outcome of them. At the
other extreme, we have the moral doctrine of the Sophists,
for whom each man's <i>will</i> was right for him&mdash;a doctrine
which reappears in every individualistic and anarchistic
age. For this doctrine, there are no valid social standards
of right and wrong. There is nothing binding on the moral
agent but his own will. In between, is the moral doctrine
of such thinkers as Friedrich Paulsen, or John Dewey,
who represent the reigning type of moral theory to-day.
For them, morality is a purely human matter. It grows
out of the needs and interests of men. What is good at
one time and place is not necessarily good at another time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
and place. There are no immutable moral principles,
valid throughout the ages. None the less, morality is not a
private matter, about which men may do as they please.
Morality is the product of an organic society, the product
of the interplay of many minds. To a given individual,
the moral law is, indeed, an external constraining and
impelling force. It is the will of the rest of the group. It
may be his own will too, but if it is not, it overrides his
personal preference, He, on the other hand, is part of the
group which constrains and guides every other individual.
There are, in fact, many sets of moral values: on the one
hand, the social moral values <i>par excellence</i>, which the
group will <i>enforce</i> in various ways; and then, for each
individual, his own moral values, which may correspond
qualitatively more or less with the group values, or may
antagonize them. But the Moral Law is the will of the
group. It is no simple composite of the moral values of
individuals. It has its organic interrelations with all phases
of social life. Economic changes modify it, legal changes
modify it, religious values modify it, all phases of social
life are expressed in it.</p>

<p>In legal theory, we find these three types of doctrine
also. The first type is clearly indicated in the general
attitude of American and English courts, especially toward
the common law, though it influences their interpretation
of all law. The law is something which the mind of man
may find out, but may not make. If a new situation arises,
the court "finds" the law&mdash;in theory the principle "discovered"
by the court was in the common law at the beginning.
Of course, we know that the judge invents the
rule he makes, to fit a novel case, but the judge himself
will not admit it. The theory of the law and the theory of
morality have developed in close connection, and the
notion of "natural right" is a juristic as well as a moral
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
idea. At the other extreme, we have from certain recent
students of law the doctrine that "The Law" is a myth,
that there is nothing but the particular opinion of a particular
judge at a particular time. Individualism cannot
go so far in legal theory as to give every individual in society
a chance to put his oar in, and have a separate law
for himself! The social and institutional character of law
is too obvious to permit that. But individualism has gone
so far in legal theory as to deny all objectivity to law except
in a given decision in a particular case. In between these
two extreme views, appear the views of writers like Savigny,
or Professor Munroe Smith, for whom the law is a changing
product of social psychology, volitional<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> rather than
intellectual in character, objective enough to the individual
who violates it, or the judge who seeks to pervert it, but
none the less not outside the minds and interests of men.
In Professor Munroe Smith's phrase, law is "that part
of the social order which by virtue of the social will may
be supported by physical force."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> I venture to describe
this type of legal theory as the "social value" theory of
the law. In the chapter on "The Reconciliation of Statics
and Dynamics," <i>infra</i>, I have cited certain opinions of
Mr. Justice Holmes which apply it, and even bring into
it the notions of the marginal analysis.</p>

<p>There are, similarly, three types of economic theory.
At the one extreme we have theories of "intrinsic" value,
which would place economic value outside the wills of
men. The medi&aelig;val discussions of "just price" often
illustrate this notion. It creeps not infrequently into judicial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
opinions,&mdash;to which such notions are essentially
congenial! The working economist of our own day has
found little use for it, but in periods when economic change
was slow it suggested itself not unnaturally to men, as an
explanation of the seeming impersonality of market phenomena,
and as a practical idea for combatting extortion
and injustice. Something of the idea is involved in a sentence
of Shakspere's:<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
"But value dwells not in particular will;<br />
It holds his estimate and dignity<br />
As well wherein 'tis precious of itself<br />
As in the prizer."<br />
</p></div>

<p>At the opposite extreme would be those economists, as
Professor Davenport and Jevons, who find no value for
a good except in the minds of individual men, so that there
may be as many different values as there are different men.
That something social and objective exists in the market
place can hardly be denied, but when pressed for an account
of it, these writers reduce it to a bare, abstract,
mathematical ratio.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Each individual mind is shut up
within its own limits, inscrutable to other minds, and there
can be no psychological phenomena which include activities
in many minds, for this view. In between these two extremes,
is the social value theory of the present writer.
Economic value is not intrinsic in goods, independent of
the minds of men. But it is a fact which is in large degree
independent of the mind of any given man. To a given
individual in the market, the economic value of a good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
is a fact as external, as objective, as opaque and stubborn,
as is the weight of the object, or the law against murder.
There are individual values, marginal utilities, of goods
which may differ in magnitude and in quality from man
to man, but there is, over and above these, influenced by
them in part, influencing them much more than they influence
it, a social value for each commodity, a product
of a complex social psychology, which includes the individual
values, but includes very much more as well. Our
theory puts law, moral values, and economic values in the
same general class, <i>species</i> of the <i>genus</i>, social value, alike
in their psychological "stuff" and character, to be explained
by the same general principles, even though differentiated
in their functions, and in the extent to which they depend
on various factors in the social situation. They are parts
of a social system of motivation and control. They are
the <i>social forces</i>, which govern, in a social scheme, the
actions of men.</p>

<p>It may be well to suggest rough <i>differenti&aelig;</i> which mark
off these values from one another. Legal values are social
values which will be enforced, if need be, by the organized
<i>physical</i> force of the group, through the government.
Moral values are social values which the group enforces
by approbation and disapprobation, by cold shoulders
and ostracism or by honor and praise. Economic values
are values which the group enforces under a system of
free enterprise, by means of profits and losses, by riches or
bankruptcy. The group may, under a communistic or
socialistic system, rely in whole or in part upon the machinery
of the law; in which case economic values appear
not in their own form as immediately guiding
production, but as "presuppositions" of some of the legal
values.</p>

<p>The differentiation of these types of social value may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
also run in terms of their <i>functions</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> though it is not so
easy to mark them off here, since their functions overlap.
The function of economic values is to guide and control
the economic activities of men, to send labor from one
industry to another, to cause one sort of thing to be produced
or another, to supply the motive force which <i>impels</i>
industry. Legal and moral values also directly affect
industry, often working to check the results which the
economic values alone would lead to&mdash;as when the law
forbids the production and sale of liquor, or checks child
labor, etc. The law, on the other hand, does not, primarily,
in its influence on industry, seek <i>positively</i> to determine its
direction. The law forbids the production of liquor, but
does not decree the production of bread. The law may
seek to affect industry positively, by protective tariffs, for
example, which aim at the building up of certain industries,
but its effects are here indirect, reached through
modifications in the economic values. Economic values,
on the other hand, do not primarily aim at the regulation
of the conduct of men outside the market place, or the
shop or the farm, etc. Economic values are not primarily
concerned with making men be good husbands or good
neighbors, or brave soldiers. Economic values may be
used, in part, for these purposes, as when a father-in-law
uses his wealth as a lever to make his son-in-law behave&mdash;or,
indeed, as a bait to get a son-in-law! It is hard to find
a phase of social life which is not touched by all types of
social values, but it is possible, roughly, to mark off those
phases of social life which are subject to primary regulation
by one or the other sort of social value.</p>

<p>The differentiation is easier when we look at the social
<i>institutions</i> which have to do primarily with the one or the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
other sort of value. Courts and legislatures are easily
marked off from stock exchanges and banking houses.
There is not so clearly an institutional nucleus for moral
values, since the church has lost its control over the moral
situation.</p>

<p>When we view the matter from the standpoint of the
<i>objects</i> of value, <i>differenti&aelig;</i> also appear. The main type
of object of moral value is modes of conduct; the "type
object" of economic value is physical things which men
eat, wear, drink, etc., even though <i>quantitatively</i> the major
part of the sum total of economic values attach to other
things, instrumental goods, lands, labor, and social relations,
like franchise rights, good will, which in the main
reflect the values of consumers' goods;<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> objects of legal
value are in large degree the same as objects of moral value,
namely, modes of conduct, but moral values attach to a
wider group of objects, and legal values attach to certain
forms of conduct which are morally indifferent.</p>

<p>It is not so easy to make the differentiation when we
view the thing from the standpoint of the consciousness
of men who are at the centre of the situation, to whose
consciousness the social values are presented. We may
put at the very forefront of the economic value of oranges
the gustatory feelings or desires of those who consume
them; at the forefront of the moral value of a heroic rescue
by a fireman the thrill that runs through the onlookers.
Qualitatively, these psychological states are different, as
those who have experienced both will know. But it is
difficult indeed to put the difference into words. When
it comes to a legal value, say the legal value of a given contract
right which a man seeks to enforce in court, it is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
easy to find any particular emotion or state of consciousness
which is peculiar or appropriate to it. The value is so
highly institutionalized and impersonal, that it seems to
the court and lawyers and even the litigants to be merely a
question of fact to be intellectually analyzed. Its roots
are deep in human emotions, but not in the emotions,
primarily, of those who are handling the transaction. Perhaps
the jurist has states of consciousness we know not of.
There may be a distinctively legal emotion. It seems to
crop out at times when one questions, in conversation with
a judge or lawyer, the infallibility of the courts. But the
law does not derive its power therefrom! Rather, the law
derives its power from the general consent and acquiescence
and support of the mass of men, who turn over to experts
the details of administering it, and who support The Law
in general, rather than the rule of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, with
their emotional sanction.</p>

<p>I think that we have here a clue to a vital point for our
theory. We need not expect to find the major part of the
explanation of any of these social values in the conscious
emotions of those who are moved by them. In the case
of the orange or the heroic act, we are, indeed, close to
pretty simple human feelings and desires. In general, in
the case of moral values, the individual emotion and the
social value are <i>qualitatively</i> comparable, since moral values
rarely take on a highly institutional character. They are
more free from class or institutional control than other
social values. This need not be true. Thus, the plantation
negro need not feel any personal shame in the moral
delinquency which he none the less hides from the "white
folks" whose values he must more or less conform to.
But, on the whole, moral values are much more "participation
values,"<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> shared by the whole group in common,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
than are economic values or legal values. When we pass
beyond the simple case of a consumption good, and get
into the realm of the more institutional economic values,
we lose all guidance from the clue of satisfactions in consumption.
Just what emotion, for example, is appropriate
in the presence of the four and a half per cent convertible
bond of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Co.? If it be
answered that ultimately that bond represents satisfactions
in consumption, since the owner of it may spend
the income for consumers' goods, or since the railroad in
question carries coal which goes to Italy to be used in a
cruiser which will sink an Austrian warship, thereby giving
consumers' satisfactions to individuals in Italy, so that
the value of the bond is ultimately reducible to specific
satisfactions of given individuals, we may still hold that
those satisfactions do not constitute the value of the bond,
as such. Moreover, the same is true of the legal values.
Ultimately, very specific human emotions are affected by
the rule of the <i>corpus delicti</i>, or the rule governing pleas in
<i>estoppel</i>. Both in legal and in economic values we have an
elaborate and complex system of social psychological character,
which can by no means be reduced to elementary
desires or feelings of individuals, even though when the
whole story is told, no part of the system will be
found outside the minds of individual men. The point
has been well put by Professor C. H. Cooley: "It would
be as reasonable to attempt to explain the theology of
St. Thomas Aquinas, or the <i>Institutes</i> of Calvin, by the
immediate working of religious instinct as to explain the
market values of the present time by the immediate working
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of natural wants."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> I think that any attempt to differentiate
the various kinds of social value on the basis of
the type of emotion in the minds of those who have most
immediately to do with them, or to explain them primarily
by those emotions, is foredoomed. The law does not get
its power from the emotion of the judge who gives a decision,
nor does the value of a rare painting rest chiefly in
the intensity of desire of the few rich connoisseurs who
compete for it. Back of the judge, giving <i>validity</i> to his
decision, stands the will of the group; back of the rich
connoisseurs stand the legal and other social values concerned
with the distribution of wealth, by virtue of which
they are able to make their wants felt in the market. Both
judge and connoisseur are focal points, through which
stream the social forces affecting the values in question.
Both are important. But the emotions and ideas of neither
exhaust the psychological causation involved in the values.</p>

<p>This is very much more apparent when we consider the
values that arise in the great speculative markets, say in
the wheat pit, or the stock exchange. Those who buy and
sell are primarily interpreters, students, of impersonal,
social forces, seeking to adjust themselves to them, to forecast
them, in such a way as to derive profit from them.
Their choices and decisions are also factors. Indeed, it is
possible to view the matter in such a way as to make their
decisions the whole story. In the same way, it is possible
to make the mind of the judge the final explanation of the
legal value. But the speculators themselves are under no
such illusion. They know very well that if they run counter
to the facts they will lose money. And the judge knows very
well that the range of arbitrary choice which he can exercise
without impeachment, or at least without reversal by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
higher court, is very limited. Nor is even a Supreme Court
of the United States free to do its arbitrary will. Just because
it is so conspicuous, and because its doings are so
important, it has manifested more respect for judicial
tradition, and more responsiveness to the tides of public
sentiment, than any other court in the Federal Judiciary.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The head of a great banking house makes a decision regarding
an underwriting operation. On his decision depends
the question of whether or not the securities are
issued. On the issue of the new securities depends, in part,
the values of the existing securities of the corporation in
question, and the nature of the future employment of
thousands of men and great quantities of land and capital.
Tremendous power is concentrated in the hands of this
banker. But it is not <i>his</i> power! He cannot exercise it in an
arbitrary or capricious way. He approaches his problem
in much the same spirit that the judge approaches a disputed
question of law. He analyzes the factors involved.
He considers the condition of the money-market, the question
of the probable ease or difficulty of marketing the new
securities to investors, the prospects of the business of the
corporation in question, the probable future demand for
its products, the stability of that demand, the personnel of
the management of the corporation, the attitude of the
government toward it, the nature of its other outstanding
securities, with special reference to the proportion of bonds
to stocks, and the amount of "fixed charges" against its
earnings. He may also take into account other enterprises
of similar character which he has connections with, and the
question of whether or not building up the corporation in
question may injure other corporations to which he has
responsibilities. He looks far into the future, seeking to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
conserve his prestige, and unwilling to assume responsibility
for an issue which investors will later lose faith in. Proximately,
his decision is tremendously important, and his
thoughts and feelings are of immense significance, but
ultimately, <i>they</i> are determined by all manner of social considerations,
and <i>always</i>, <i>the degree to which they count</i> in
determining values depends on his weight in the economic
situation, which rests (1) on his <i>prestige</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, the massing of
beliefs and hopes of many men, (2) on his <i>wealth</i>, which
rests in the legal and moral values governing distribution,
and (3) on his institutional relationships, which again are
psychological facts, partly legal in character. He is as
much a social instrument as is the judge. Both may abuse
their power. Both do at times abuse their power. But
the significant point is that the power both have is social
power, and is in no sense proportional to the intensity of
their own emotions. It arises from the emotional power in
the minds of many men.</p>

<p>It would be easy to elaborate the points in which morals,
laws, and economic values are alike, and to show in detail
that the theory of economic value is merely a special case
of the general theory of social value. For our present purposes,
however, it is enough to have illustrated the general
doctrine, and to have set up the economic values as true
social forces. It may be noticed that the effort to differentiate
the different kinds of value is not altogether
successful. They are not in watertight compartments in
social life. It is a commonplace among students of ethics
that moral values grow, in greater or less degree, out of
economic factors. Indeed, the "economic interpretation of
history" has as its central theme the doctrine that morality,
law, and ideal values in general are governed by the economic
situation. This is a one-sided view. Moral and
legal values are influenced and modified by economic forces.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Legal and moral values do, in part, derive their power from
economic values. But on the other hand, economic values
likewise derive part of their power from legal and moral
values. The "social mind" is an organic whole, in which
no factors exist "pure," and in which there is constant give
and take. The effort to explain moral values by a single
principle, as sympathy, legal values by another simple principle,
as fear, and economic values by a different simple
principle, as utility, is foredoomed. It has been given up
by the students of law and morals, and should be abandoned
by the students of economics.</p>

<p>Let us consider more narrowly the main factors affecting
and explaining economic social values. Let us take, first,
the simplest case, that of goods and services which minister
directly to human wants, goods and services "of the first
order." Goods of this sort would be oranges, bread, clothing,
jewels. Services of this sort would be the services of
the barber, the valet, the physician, the preacher, the
teacher, the actor. I abstract, in discussing these values,
from the complications that grow out of the friction in retail
trade, and the existence of many customary prices, and
prices fixed by other than economic values, in the case of
teachers, or preachers. I shall concentrate attention upon
such things as oranges, bread, clothing, and jewels. The
<i>focus</i> of the values of these things, and an essential condition
of their existence, is their utility, that is to say, their
power to satisfy human wants. Utility as used in economics
does not mean usefulness in any moral sense. From the
standpoint of the economist, whiskey and opium are as
useful as bread, if they satisfy wants equally intense. And
the economist is not concerned with the general utility of
things considered in their totality. Air is more useful than
jewels, but a carat of air is not as useful as a one-carat
diamond. Air exists in such abundance that it does not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
need to be economized. Scarcity with reference to the extent
of the wants involved is also essential to economic
value. A combination of the ideas of utility and scarcity
gives us the simple notion for which the formidable name of
"marginal utility" has been devised. The marginal utility
of a good to a man is the power the last, or "marginal,"
unit of the good which the man consumes has to give him
satisfaction, or, viewed from the standpoint of the man, is
the intensity of his desire<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> for, or of his satisfaction in, the
final unit consumed. So far, our account of the value of the
orange will seem perfectly acceptable to those accustomed
to traditional discussions of the problem in the text-books.
The difference is that many text-books stop at this point,
leaving the impression that with the definition of marginal
utility the whole value problem has been solved. For the
social value theory, the conception of marginal utility is
barely a starting point. Indeed, it is not even a starting
point. We shall have to look both in front of it and <i>behind
it</i>. Recognizing that marginal utilities to individuals are
essential to economic values of consumption goods, we
shall have to point out other things which are also essential,
and we shall have to explain the factors determining these
marginal utilities themselves.</p>

<p>The last point may be considered first. Men's desires
are socially determined. Even the simplest, most instinctive,
wants of human nature are, in their concrete manifestations,
the product of social culture in overwhelming
degree. Consider sex and hunger. We do not enjoy our
food when our neighbors pick their teeth with their forks.
This would not trouble a chimpanzee, whose <i>instinctive</i>
equipment in the matter of hunger is vastly more like that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
of a man than is the <i>actual</i> hunger impulse of a highly
civilized man like that of a savage. Civilized men will
often starve rather than eat human flesh. Even when moral
scruples are overcome, actual physical revulsion may
prevent it. Men of different times and places wish food
of special sorts, served in special ways. They wish to eat
in the company of their fellows, but only of those fellows
who can know and obey the ritual that is appropriate to
the time and place. This is true of humble folk as of those
who "dress for dinner." The ritual differs for the two
sorts of people. But there is a spirit, a type of conversation,
a code of etiquette, which prevails at the mealtime of
virtually all men, and too serious digressions therefrom
will take away the appetites of all. About the mealtime
and the festal board have gathered a great host of traditions,
ideals, and social activities, till they have become
in verity an institution, and not the least important, by
any means, of social institutions. Out of the simple instinct
of sex, we have evolved many of the most precious
things of our civilization, and between the sex impulse
of the animal and the sex impulse of the gentleman who
is seeking to marry the one woman in all the world, there
is a difference so great that comparison between the two
is difficult.</p>

<p>Here we have wants which grow out of the most elementary
things in human nature, wants which are intense and
universal, but which vary, in their concrete manifestations,
enormously from age to age and from place to place.
When we come to the wants which change more quickly,
the fact that social factors dominate needs no arguing.
Fashion, mode, custom, obviously account for the concrete
wants that exist in clothing, ornamentation, amusement,
housing, etc. If we wish to know what women will be
wanting to wear six months hence, we do not go to women
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
individually and ask them. We could not find out that
way. They would not know. We go rather to the theatre,
and study the stage and the boxes, to the famous designers
of women's dress, to the metropolitan centres of various
sorts, to the "radiant points of social control"<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> from which
emanate the suggestions which pass in imitative waves
through the women of the country in the next few months.
The laws of imitation have been elaborately developed
by Bagehot, Tarde, Baldwin, Ross, LeBon, Cooley, and
others, and I content myself here with referring to their
writings. The wants of women&mdash;and men&mdash;are socially
given, grow out of a give and take, a social process. And
in this social process, it is not true that each man counts
one! Rather, a few lead, and many follow. There are
centres of prestige which count overwhelmingly.</p>

<p>Certain wants are competitive.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Where social status
depends on having as good a house as one's neighbors, and
where social leadership depends on having a better house
than one's neighbors, there is no limit to men's desires
for better houses. With each improvement which one
introduces, each feels the desire to improve, however contented
he might have been had the other not made the
improvement. To this we shall recur in our discussion
of the origin of money, in explaining the value of
gold.</p>

<p>So much for the human wants which stand as the focus
of economic values in the case of articles of immediate
consumption.</p>

<p>But, given these wants, and given their marginal intensities,
we are only at the beginning of our explanation
of the economic values of the consumption goods. It is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
again not a case of each want counting one, to the extent
of its intensity. There are again, by virtue of the legal
and moral values governing the distribution of wealth,
<i>centres</i> of power. The wants of some men count for nothing,
however intense they may be. The pauper, the prisoner,
the beggar&mdash;popular proverb about "beggars and horses"
understands them, however much the "marginal utilitarian"
may forget that their wants count for nothing.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The
slightest whim, on the other hand, of the man who has
inherited millions may count heavily in giving values to
goods. For the explanation of the values of consumption
goods, then, we need both the socially determined marginal
utilities of individuals, and the socially determined <i>weight</i>
which these individuals have in our economic system.
This <i>weight</i> would involve a very elaborate explanation.
Many factors affect it. We call attention here, however,
especially to the fact that it rests in large part on the legal
and moral values and institutions concerned with the distribution
of wealth. Changes in the distribution of wealth
are as important as changes in the wants themselves in
giving the explanation of changes in values. The economic
social values of consumption goods include not merely
the values of those goods <i>to</i> the individuals who consume
them, but also the values <i>of</i> the individuals themselves
in the social scheme of things.</p>

<p>What of the values of instrumental goods, of goods of
"higher orders," of labor, of stocks and bonds, of lands,
of franchise rights and good will?</p>

<p>It is the one great contribution of the Austrian economists
to have shown that the causation in value runs,
primarily, from consumption goods to the goods of higher
"orders" which are concerned with their production, and
that these values of instrumental goods, etc., are derived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and secondary values. The value of wheat is based on
the value of bread, the value of land on the value of wheat.
The value of the stock of United States Steel rests in part
on the value of iron lands, which rests on the value of ore,
which rests on the value of pig iron, which rests on the
value of steel rails, which rests on the value of the service
of transporting building materials, which rests on the
value of a building, which rests on the value of the services
which a dentist performs in an office in the building. This
is the main line of causation. This is the first approximation
which gives us a clue, without which we should find
problems insoluble. But is it not clear that this cannot
be the whole story? At every step complications enter.
The whole thing cannot be got out of the value of the dentist's
services, and the other consumers' goods and services,
which are indirectly aided by the property to which title
is given by ownership of U.S. Steel stock; nor is the value
of the stock to be fully explained by the value of the property
to which it gives title.</p>

<p>At every step, we meet the complication that men must
estimate and calculate, for one thing. And rarely indeed
can men see all the steps, the end from the beginning.
Take first a very simple case, wheat land. The value of
the wheat land of to-day rests on the value of wheat, but it
is the wheat of to-morrow and for many years to come; the
wheat of to-morrow rests for its value on the value of the
bread of the day after to-morrow. Sometimes the differential
between goods at two consecutive steps in the productive
process is pretty constant. Wheat and flour vary pretty
closely together. The differential is not strictly fixed even
there. But bread and wheat land have a much looser connection
in their variations. If land could produce no wheat
or corn or other good that would satisfy human wants, and
if it could not itself satisfy human wants, it would ordinarily
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
have no value.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But the connection between the value of
the bread and the value of the land is loose and uncertain,
while the connection between the value of the land and the
intensity of the wants actually satisfied by the bread produced
from it, is absolutely <i>nil</i>. Whether the bread saves
a starving man or feeds the pet pigeons of a millionaire, is
a matter of indifference so far as the value of the land (or of
the bread) is concerned.</p>

<p>We take the values of consumption goods, and break
them up, attributing part to the labor that immediately
produced them, part to the raw materials that entered into
them, part to the machine that fashioned them, and so on.
We then break up the value attributed to the raw material,
attributing part to the labor that worked in producing it
immediately, part to the machine that fashioned it, part to
the rawer material of which it was made. And so with the
values of the machines. Ultimately we get back to the
values of labor, or of land, or of securities giving title to
complexes of lands, machines, etc.&mdash;values which we do
not further break up. But at every step, we find additional
factors. We find these derived values becoming independent,
substantial, standing in their own right. Moral and
legal values affect them directly, as in the case of patriotic
support of government securities, moral antagonism to the
securities of the Distillers' Securities Corporation, or the
influence of court decisions, legislation and elections on security
values. Such values rest, in large degree, on the
massing of <i>beliefs</i> and hopes, not concerned with specific
satisfactions of wants, but with the existence of <i>future</i> economic
values. These beliefs and hopes again have their social
explanation. It is not a case where each man counts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
one. There are centres of prestige and power, bankers and
financial magnates, whose opinions and decisions count
heavily, and waves of optimism and pessimism, which affect
the whole group. We shall discuss these matters more
fully in connection with the analysis of credit, at a later
point of our study. For the present, it is enough to point
out that the whole thing cannot be explained on the basis
of the values of consumers' goods, and that the values of
consumers' goods are only in small part explained by the
intensities of the wants they serve.</p>

<p>In summary: Economic value is the common quality of
wealth, by virtue of which it is possible to compare divers
kinds of wealth, and treat wealth quantitatively, getting
ratios of exchange, sums of wealth, etc. Value is a quantity,
<i>i. e.</i>, a quality which has degrees of intensity. Ratios
of exchange are ratios between values. Price is a particular
sort of ratio of exchange, namely, a ratio in which one of
the terms is the value of the money-unit. Prices correctly
express values on the assumption of the fluid market, and
on the assumption that the value of the money-unit does
not vary.</p>

<p>The value quality is psychological in character. It rests
in human minds. But not in the minds of individuals
thought of separately. It is a complex of many individual
mental activities, highly institutionalized, and including
legal and moral values, hopes and beliefs and expectations,
as well as the immediate intensities of men's wants for consumption
goods.</p>

<p>The ultimate test of scientific theory must be practice.
If a theory aids in manipulating facts, if it leads to the discovery
of ways of doing things which are better than old
ways, if it solves problems which have hitherto remained
unsolved, or carries the solution of problems farther than
has hitherto been the case, it is a good theory. It need not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
be the best possible theory. It need not be a final theory.
The chief claim for the present theory of value is that it not
only unlocks all the doors that earlier theories have unlocked,
but also others which have resisted the old keys.
The man who goes into the modern stock market armed
with marginal utility and the quantity theory is like the
man who would fight Hindenburg with bows and arrows.
Bows and arrows are effective in the hands of expert archers,
and the great figures in the history of economics have done
wonderful things with marginal utility, "real costs," and
the quantity theory. But the social value theory is offered
as a better weapon.</p>

<p>The writer believes that the problem of the value of
money has not been solved by the older theories of value.
He believes that the social value theory will solve it. He
proposes on the basis of the social value theory to make
clearer the nature of credit phenomena, and to assimilate
the laws of credit to the general laws of value. He proposes
with the social value theory to bring together in a
higher synthesis two divergent types of economic theory,
the "static" and the "dynamic." He thinks that a rigorous
and consistent application of the absolute concept of
value will clarify confusions at various points in the general
body of price theory, as the laws of supply and demand,
etc.</p>

<p>He offers the social value theory as the only way of giving
a <i>psychological</i> explanation to the demand-curve, and a
marginal <i>value</i> explanation of marginal demand-<i>price</i>. Demand-curves
are social value curves, on the assumption of
the fixed social value of the dollar. The utility theory, as
will appear in the chapter on "Marginal Utility," has
failed to give psychological magnitudes corresponding to
<i>any</i> point on the demand-curve. In general, he offers the
social value notion as the justification for the assumption
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of a quantitative value which, as we shall see, underlies the
whole of our current price analysis.</p>

<p>The theory here outlined has been, as stated, developed
and defended more fully in a previous book. For the rest,
the author would have it judged by its usefulness or failure
as a tool of thought in the investigations which follow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> It has seemed best not to break the main course of the argument
of this chapter for the elaboration of one point on which there
has appeared to some critics to be vagueness in the exposition of the
social value theory in my earlier volume, namely, the relation of social
values to the individual values of those who are moved by the social
values. Social values have as their function the guidance and control
of the activities of men. But men are also moved by their own individual
feelings, interests, and desires.</p>

<p>What is the relation between these two sets of factors? In what
has gone before, it has been made clear that social values present
themselves to the individual as opaque, objective facts, largely beyond
his control, to which he must adjust himself. They represent
the minds of other men, acting in corporate and organic ways, putting
pressure on him, or offering him lures. Now the individual
reckons with these social values in the same way that he reckons with
any other of the facts affecting the economy of his life. He must
adjust himself to them in the same way that he must, if he is a blacksmith,
adjust himself to the technical qualities of the iron he is manipulating.
This does not mean that he is passive before them, any more
than he is passive before the iron. He rather seeks to carry out his
personal purposes and desires by actively adapting himself to objective
facts, whatever they be. This means that different individuals
will react in different ways to the same social value. The fear of
the law will keep one man from burning dead leaves in the street
where it will not keep another man from murder. A given degree
of social pressure will make one man crease his trousers, while another
man will not even know that the pressure to crease one's trousers
exists! There are great individual variations in responsiveness and
sensitiveness to social pressure. In part, these variations are due to
inborn qualities. In larger part, they are due to social education,
and to social status. Thus, the fact that one man will work all day
in a ditch in response to the lure of a dollar and a half, while another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
will not work in the ditch for a hundred dollars a day, may rest in
slight degree on the greater inborn sensitiveness of the latter to the
physical pain of labor, but rests primarily on the fact that the latter
doesn't need the money, and has a social standard, growing out of
his class-associations and education, which would make him ashamed
to be seen in the ditch. Indeed, we may think of the social standard
in question as a social value acting <i>on</i> him, rather than <i>in</i> him.
He fears ridicule. The same degree of social power, luring men
toward the ditch, exists in the dollar in each case, but the response
is very different in the two cases.</p>

<p>Later formulations of the utility theory and the labor cost theory,
as represented by the theory of Schumpeter, which we shall discuss
in the chapter on "Marginal Utility," give us, in a scheme of purely
static equilibrium, a picture of the adjustment of the individual
values to the social values. As we shall see, they give us no account
whatever of the social values. They do not explain causation at all.
But they do show that there is a tendency for the individual marginal
utilities of consumption to become proportional to the social values
of the goods consumed by each individual; and for the individual
marginal disutilities in production to become proportional to the
social values of the rewards that come to producers. The scheme is
highly unrealistic. It has been emphatically repudiated by B&ouml;hm-Bawerk,
so far as the disutility equilibrium is concerned. ("Ultimate
Standard of Value," <i>Annals of the American Academy</i>, Vol. V, pp.
149-209.) But it is worth something, not as explaining social values
or market prices, but rather, as showing how individuals <i>conform</i> to
social values and market prices. <i>Cf. Social Value</i>, pp. 43-44, n. 2,
and 148.</p>

<p>The theory that individual marginal utilities and disutilities are
proportional to market values is unrealistic enough, in the light of
the analysis of individual utilities which we have given, even for the
utilities. It is quite impossible to make anything of importance
of it from the side of individual disutilities. The length of the working
day is not fixed for each worker by a comparison of his own labor
pain with the satisfactions he expects from his wages. It is fixed by
conditions largely external to him, and the whole group works the
same number of hours, with the machine. The law may limit the
working day. Trades-union effort may do it. Opportunities for
alternative employment may do it, for the labor force of a factory as
a whole. But the theory, which really must rest in the notion that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
each individual has many options, and that the working period is
flexible, cannot mean much. The prosperity of the laborer does more
to limit the working day than does his suffering!</p>

<p>The reactions of individuals as consumers or producers on the
social values modify the social values. But, as we have shown, the
primary explanation of the social values is not to be found in the
individual utilities and disutilities of those who react to them. Utilities
and labor pains are parts, but minor parts, in the explanation
of social values.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h3>SUPPLY AND DEMAND, AND THE VALUE OF
MONEY</h3>


<p>The theory of the value of money is a special case of the
general theory of economic value. To the layman, this
would seem to go without saying. To the student of the
literature of the subject, however, who has noticed the wide
divergence between the method of approach to the general
problem of value and the method of approach to the problem
of the value of money, in most treatises which include both
these topics, the proposition will sound unusual if not heretical.
Most text-books in English to-day will offer the marginal
utility theory as the general theory of value. The same
books commonly present the quantity theory of the value of
money. Whether or not the two theories are consistent
may wait for later discussion, but that the quantity theory
of money is a <i>deduction from</i> the utility theory of value, and
a <i>special case</i> of the utility theory of value, will not, I believe,
be contended by anyone. Certainly in its origin, the
quantity theory is much the older theory. The same is
true for those writers who seek to explain value in general
on the basis of cost of production, and who at the same time
offer the quantity theory to explain the value of money.
The two theories may or may not be consistent, but in any
case, they are logically and historically independent,
neither being a deduction from the other. Older writers
(as Walker and Mill), whose treatment of the general
theory of value runs in terms of "supply and demand,"
have stated that the quantity theory is merely a special case
of the law of supply and demand, and the statement is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
occasionally met in present-day writings, though one of the
most recent and best known of the expositions of the
quantity theory, Professor Fisher's <i>Purchasing Power of
Money</i>, very explicitly repudiates this doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> But it
may be easily shown, and will be shown later, that the
quantity theory, and the present-day formulation of the
law of supply and demand, are in no way logically dependent
upon each other. This lack of connection between two
bodies of doctrine which should be in a most intimate and
essential way related to each other, may well throw suspicion
on the current treatments of both topics. In any
case the lack of connection raises a problem, and calls for
explanation.</p>

<p>Part of the explanation may be sought in the fact that
the writers who have developed the general theory of value
have not been, in general, the writers who have most
elaborated the theory of the value of money. The theory
of money has been for a long time a more or less isolated
discipline. In Ricardo, we have an elaboration of the labor
theory of value, and we also have the quantity theory of
money. But it is not clear that Ricardo added anything to
the quantity theory. He found it, in much the form in
which he used it, in the writings of predecessors, among
them Locke and Hume. Ricardo makes large use of the
quantity theory as a premise, but apparently feels the
theory to be so self-evident that it needs little exposition or
defence at his hands. John Stuart Mill is a clear exception
to the general statement. Cairnes, likewise, did treat both
topics in considerable detail, but while his interest in the
general theory of value was that of the theorist, his treatment
of money was primarily in the spirit of the publicist,
and his interest was less in the justification of the theory&mdash;which
he again seems to feel needs little defence&mdash;as in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
application. A similar statement may be made with reference
to Jevons. He worked out his general theory of value
for its own sake; his utterances on the theory of the value
of money must be sought scattered through his practical
writings on money. Alfred Marshall's <i>Principles</i> (Vol. I)
says almost nothing about the theory of money; his opinions
on that subject are to be found in some <i>ex cathedra</i> replies
to questions from a Parliamentary Commission. The most
important discussions in England of the value of money are
to be found in the long polemic between the Currency and
the Banking Schools, by writers who would not be listed
among the makers of the general theory of value. In the
United States to-day, with the exceptions of Professors
Fisher and Taussig, the writers who have been interested
in the general field of economic theory have done comparatively
little with the value of money (<i>e. g.</i>, Professors
Clark and Fetter), and the writers who have been most
interested in the value of money have usually not written
largely on the general theory of value (<i>e. g.</i>, Professors
Laughlin, Scott, Kinley). Professor Kemmerer might well
be included as an illustration of this last statement. His
primary interest is in money, rather than general theory,
even though he does precede his theory of the value of
money with an exposition of the utility theory of value.
In German, a similar situation obtains. B&ouml;hm-Bawerk has
touched the theory of money scarcely at all. Menger has
written an important article on "Geld" in the <i>Handw&ouml;rterbuch
der Staatswissenschaften</i>, but the important thing about
this article is the theory of the origin of money, and the
reader will find little on the problem of the value of money.
Wieser has recently taken up the value of money (in articles
published in 1904 and 1909), but no trace of his views has as
yet manifested itself in the English literature on money,
and the writer may here express the opinion that Wieser's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
contributions to the theory of money are not likely to be
very influential, or to add to his reputation.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Austrian
writers on the value of money, as Wieser and von Mises,
have recognized more clearly than anyone in America or
England, the essential dependence of the theory of the
value of money on the general theory of value. The German
writer on money who has attracted most attention
recently, however, G. F. Knapp, troubles himself about the
general theory of value not at all.</p>

<p>But the main explanation of the hiatus between the two
bodies of literature and doctrine is to be sought in something
more fundamental. Neither utility nor costs nor
supply and demand furnishes an adequate basis from which
the quantity theory, or any other theory of the value of
money can be deduced. The cost theory, and the supply
and demand theory, in their present-day formulation, are
really not theories of value at all, but are theories of <i>prices</i>,
theories which presuppose <i>value</i>, and <i>money</i>, and a <i>fixed
value of money</i>. And the utility theory, as usually presented,
is either a theory of barter relations, or else (more
commonly) speedily settles down into the grooves of supply
and demand, leaping by means of a confusion of utility
curves and demand-curves (or sometimes by a deliberate
identification of them, <i>e. g.</i>, Flux and Taussig<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>) to the
treatment of market prices. I shall take up these points in
order.</p>

<p>A historical summary of the development of the notions
of supply and demand will aid the exposition. It may be
noticed, first of all, that supply and demand is really a very
superficial formula even though an exceedingly useful one.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
By virtue of its superficial character, it antagonizes few
other theories, and it has been the common property of
almost all schools of value theory. Cost theories and
utility theories, labor theories, or social value theories, all
find use for it, in one form or another. It is really quite
neutral and colorless, so far as the ultimate questions of
value-causation are concerned. The more fundamental
causal factors offered by one theory or another are commonly
supposed to operate <i>through</i> supply or demand, in
price-determination. Adam Smith seems to see this more
clearly than does Ricardo. Ricardo, indeed, sometimes
thought of demand and supply as forces antithetical to the
forces of labor-costs which he was considering. In ch. xxx
of his <i>Principles of Political Economy and Taxation</i> (ed.
McCulloch, pp. 232ff.) he holds that his natural value ultimately
rules, except (p. 234) in the case of monopolized
articles. Supply and demand govern the prices of monopolized
articles and of all articles in the short run. I do not
find in Ricardo any clear statement to the effect that cost
of production operates <i>through</i> influence on supply. Neither
Adam Smith nor Ricardo felt the need of very much precision
in the definition of supply and demand. Smith does,
indeed, distinguish "effectual" from "absolute" demand,
in a well-known passage (ed. Cannan, I, p. 58), defining
effectual demand as the demand of the effectual demanders,
<i>i. e.</i>, these who are willing to pay the "natural price"
of the commodity. The term "supply" he does not use
in this passage, but speaks of the "quantity which is actually
brought to market," and gives as the law of market
price that it is determined by the "proportion" between
this quantity and the effectual demand. That much is
wanting in this analysis will be sufficiently clear when the
views of J. S. Mill and Cairnes are considered. Ricardo
offers even less than Smith in the way of definition. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
reader may compare the pages in <i>Ricardo's Works</i> cited
above, and the discussion of the demand for labor on p. 241
in the same volume.</p>

<p>In J.S. Mill, a clean-cut notion first appears. The doctrine
that price is determined by a ratio between effectual demand
(<i>i. e.</i>, the wish to possess combined with the power to purchase)
and supply (<i>i. e.</i>, the quantity available in the market),
is sharply criticised. How have a ratio between two
things not of the same denomination? "What ratio can
there be between a quantity and a desire, or even a desire
combined with a power?" To make supply and demand
comparable, demand must be defined as "quantity demanded,"
and then the difficulty arises that the quantity
demanded will vary with the price, which seems to present
a case of circular reasoning if demand is to be a determinant
of price. The solution which Mill develops for this difficulty
really gives us our modern conception, virtually complete
except that Mill does not present it in the useful
diagrammatic form and does not whisper the magic word,
"margin." There is a demand-schedule, which, plotted,
would give a demand-curve. At such and such prices, such
and such quantities are demanded, or will be purchased.
There is a supply schedule, presenting a supply situation
of similar character (though not so clearly indicated).
The price reached is that price which <i>equalizes</i> amount demanded
and amount supplied. A higher price will lead to
competition among sellers, forcing down the price, a lower
price will lead to competition among buyers, forcing up the
price. The notion of a <i>ratio</i> between supply and demand
is replaced by the notion of an <i>equation</i> between them. The
present writer wishes to remark, in this connection, that
B&ouml;hm-Bawerk's elaborate analysis, with his "marginal
pairs," etc., has not advanced one step beyond this conception
of Mill's, that it is really less satisfactory than Mill's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
analysis, because of the impedimenta of pseudo-psychology
it has to carry, and because of its confusion of utility schedules
with demand schedules.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In our present-day expositions,
as presented in the diagrams, we are accustomed to
say that price is fixed when marginal supply-price and
marginal demand-price are equal, putting the stress on the
ordinate, rather than on the abscissa, on the identity of the
dollars paid or received, rather than on the identity of the
goods given or received. But this is merely another way of
stating the same equilibrium which Mill perceived&mdash;when
marginal demand and supply prices are equal, amount
supplied and amount demanded will be equal, and conversely.</p>

<p>One point is to be added, making explicit what is implicit
in the modern theory of supply and demand. Supply and
demand doctrine assumes <i>money</i>, and a <i>fixed value</i> of money.
That there should be a given schedule of money-prices for
varying quantities of a good, is possible only if there be a
given value of the money-unit.</p>

<p>That the modern doctrine of supply and demand necessarily
involves the assumptions of value, of money, and of
a fixed value of money, may be proved by the following
considerations:</p>

<p>Supply-situation, represented by the supply-curve, and
demand-situation, represented by the demand-curve, are
conceived of as antithetical and independent causal forces,
whose equilibrium determines both "supply and demand"
(in the sense of quantities supplied and demanded) and
price. Mill's doctrine that supply and demand determine
price gets out of the circle that demand (amount
demanded) is itself dependent on price, only by making
both demand in this sense and price <i>results</i>, rather
than causes, and by putting the causation back into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
the more complex factors which I call "supply-situation"
and "demand-situation." The two independent causes,
then, are summed up in the supply-curve and the demand-curve.
But, first, these curves are expressed in money.
And second, a change in the value of money would
affect <i>both</i> of them proportionately. But a theory which
is concerned with supply and demand as independent
and antithetical must abstract from factors which give
them a <i>common</i> movement, without modifying their <i>relation</i>
to each other. A change in the value of money
would lead the supply-curve to move to the right, and the
demand-curve to move to the left, the change in each being
proportionate, and the amount supplied, and amount demanded,
would remain unchanged. Changes in the value
of money must, therefore, be abstracted from.</p>

<p>Again, we must precise the notion of an <i>increase</i> in demand,
or of supply. Increase in demand may mean mere
increase in amount demanded, consequent upon a lower
price, consequent, <i>i. e.</i>, upon a lowering of the supply schedule.
In this sense, increase in demand is a passive fact, a
result rather than a cause. On the other hand, if the increase
in demand is an increase in the amount demanded
at the <i>same</i> price, if it means a change in the demand-situation,
represented by the moving to the right of the demand-curve,
we have a causal factor in increase in demand, a
factor which raises the price and compels new supply to
come into the market. We may distinguish these two
meanings as increase in demand in the active and in the
passive senses. <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, we may speak of increase
of supply in the active and passive senses. These
distinctions have been made before, but it has not been
clearly seen that these distinctions, and the connected
doctrines, involve the assumption of a fixed value of
money. But consider: it is the current doctrine that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
increase in demand in the active sense, the demanding
of a greater amount at the same price, the moving of the
demand-curve to the right, not only raises the price, but
also tends to <i>increase the supply</i>. But this is true only if
the <i>cause</i> of the increase in demand is not a cause which
simultaneously works on supply, neutralizing that tendency.
If the increase in amount demanded at a given price be due
to a lowered value of money, then the same lowered value
of money will reduce the supply available at that price <i>pro
tanto</i>, and the new equilibrium, <i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>, will be at a
higher price, to be sure, but with the same amount supplied
and demanded. "Demand" is a term which carries the
connotation of motivating power in economic theory.
Through demand run the forces which regulate production
and supply. The function of increased demand is to induce
increased supply. But the value concept, and the
assumption of a fixed value of money, are needed to preserve
this part of the doctrine. Without them we have no
way of distinguishing a <i>real</i> increase in demand in the active
sense, which does modify the adjustments in production,
and alter the proportions of different supplies, from a <i>nominal</i>
increase in demand in the active sense, which merely
raises a money-price, without affecting supply.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Another approach will lead to the same conclusion. Demand
and supply-curves are not to be understood merely
in terms of brute, physical quantities. They are rather
curves expressing economic <i>significances</i>, manifesting <i>psychological</i>
forces which lie behind them. No considerations
of mere physical quantity will explain why one demand-curve
should be "elastic" and another inelastic,&mdash;each
curve has its own peculiarities, which are not mechanical
in their nature. Demand-curves express the diminishing
economic significance of goods as their quantity is increased.
How economic significance is to be interpreted need not be
argued here. I have elsewhere undertaken to show that
the utility theory of value does not explain the economic
significance which demand-curves express&mdash;that demand-curves
are not utility curves. My own theory is that demand-curves
are to be explained only in terms of a social
psychology, that demand-curves are social-value curves.
But my argument at this point does not rest on the particular
type of causal theory of value one chooses. It is
enough that the demand-curve be recognized as expressing
economic significance, and diminishing economic significance.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
But for the demand-curve to express variation in
economic significance of a good, there is need for a unit in
which to express that variation. That unit is the economic
significance of the dollar, itself assumed to be invariable&mdash;as
all measures must be assumed to be invariable if measurement
is to mean anything. If the unit chosen vary in the
course of a given investigation, the curve tells you nothing
at all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Another way of reaching the same conclusion is to say
that an increase in demand in the active sense will lead to an
increase in supply only if there be no corresponding increase
in demand for the alternative employments of the sources
of that supply, that, <i>e. g.</i>, an increased demand for wheat
will lead to increased production of wheat only if there be
not a corresponding increase in the demands for corn and
other crops which can be raised on land and with labor and
capital that would otherwise produce wheat. This is only
another phase of the argument that went before, that an
increase in demand due to a falling value of money would
lead to a corresponding shift in the supply-curve. It is not
quite the same argument, however, because that was an argument
concerned with short run tendencies, resting on the
assumption that the holders of supply would immediately
react to a change in the value of money, whereas the argument
just presented rests on the longer adjustments, based
on the law of costs, as worked out by the Austrians. This
point will be made clearer in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Yet another, and perhaps simpler, approach to the same
conclusion is by pointing out that an individual, deciding
to buy, must take account of the prices of other things in
his budget&mdash;that individual demand-schedules would be
different if market prices of other things&mdash;which depend on
the value of money&mdash;were different.</p>

<p>The doctrine that supply and demand (and cost of production,
the capitalization theory, and other elements in
the current price-analysis) presuppose a fixed value of
money, must be sharply distinguished from the doctrine of
Professor Fisher (<i>Purchasing Power of Money</i>, ch. 8), and
others, that a fixed <i>general price level</i> is assumed by supply
and demand, etc. I should deny that a fixed general price
level is assumed. The point rests in the distinction between
value as <i>absolute</i> and value as <i>relative</i>. For my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
theory, it is perfectly possible for the general price level to
rise, with the value of money constant, because of a rise in
the values of <i>goods</i>. In a later chapter, on "The Passiveness
of Prices," I shall examine the doctrine of Professor
Fisher more closely, and set these two views in clearer contrast.
For the present, it is enough to point out one vital
difference between a rise in prices due to a fall in the value
of money and a rise in prices due to a rise in the values of
goods, with the absolute value of money unchanged: in the
latter case, there is an increase in the psychological stimulus
to industry, an increase in economic power in motivation,
which energizes and increases production. In the latter
case, especially when the fall in the value of money is rapid,
and the rise in prices is clearly due to that cause (as in the
case of Confederate paper, or the French <i>Assignats</i>), we
find a reverse effect on industry. Intermediate cases,
where money is falling in value, but where goods are also
rising, give us intermediate results.</p>

<p>In what follows, I shall from time to time refer to this
distinction. In my own exposition, I shall always use
"value of money" in the absolute sense, as distinguished
from the mere "reciprocal of the price level,"&mdash;a practice
which I have sought to justify in the chapter on "Value,"
and in other places there referred to.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The modern theory of supply and demand, then, assumes
money, and a fixed value of money. It is, therefore, obviously
unfitted as an instrument to solve the problem of
the value of money. If supply and demand concepts are
to be applied to this problem, they must be of a different
sort. This was pointed out by Cairnes<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> who criticised<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Mill's formulation, and pointed out that Mill departed
from it in three capital doctrines: in the theory of the value
of money, in the theory of wages, and in the theory of international
values. By the demand for money, Mill means,
not the amount of <i>money</i> demanded, but the quantity of
goods offered against money&mdash;a very different conception.
(Mill, <i>Principles</i>, Bk. III, ch. viii, par. 2.) In what sense
a quantity of goods can equal a quantity of money, or in
what sense there can be a ratio between goods and money,
(to recur to Mill's former problem as to the ratio between
things not of the same denomination) Mill does not make
clear, nor is it defensible to speak of either a ratio or an
equation on the basis of Mill's system, since Mill had no
absolute value concept. Cairnes seeks to reconstruct the
notion of supply and demand, in such fashion as to make it
possible to apply it universally, and takes up the question
of the comparability of supply conceived as a quantity of
goods, and demand, conceived, not as a quantity of goods,
but as desire combined with the ability to pay. He concludes
that in both supply and demand there is a physical,
as well as a mental, element. Demand he defines as
the desire for a commodity backed by general purchasing
power; supply as the desire for general purchasing power,
backed by the offer of a commodity. Thus he thinks he
has made the two of the same denomination, so that comparison
may be instituted between them, and the ideas of
equation, ratio, and proportion made legitimate. By
"general purchasing power," Cairnes seems to mean money
and the representatives of money. It is not an abstract
power, since it is the "physical" element in demand, comparable
with, and of the same denomination with, the physical
element in supply, a commodity. Cairnes' solution of
Mill's difficulty seems to me to be merely verbal, however.
First, in what way is the desire for general purchasing power<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
in the mind of one man comparable with the desire for a
commodity in the mind of another man? I pass over the
supposed difficulty that knowledge of other men's emotions
is impossible,<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and emphasize simply the point that
price offer, either by demander or supplier, is no test of the
intensity of desire where there are inequalities in the distribution
of wealth. But second: in what sense is general
purchasing power, money and money-funds, of the same
denomination as a commodity? Cairnes emphasizes the
physical character of both. But surely they are not comparable
on the basis of any physical attributes&mdash;weight,
bulk, etc. Certainly if we look at the concept of demand
here given, the physical aspect is simply irrelevant&mdash;gold
money goes by weight, but what of paper money and credit
instruments? And in what sense is even gold money physically
of the same denomination with, say, wheat, or hay
or base-ball tickets? Not physical quantities, but economic
quantities, are relevant here; not weight or bulk, but
<i>value</i>. By means of a concept of value, as the homogeneous
quality of wealth, present in each piece of wealth in definite,
quantitative degree, could Cairnes bring about comparability
between the "physical" elements in supply and demand.
But not otherwise. Only significances, values, are
relevant here. Supply and demand presuppose value.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to consider the effort to solve the
problem of the value of money by means of supply and
demand on the lines employed by Mill, where demand for
money is defined as quantity of goods to be exchanged, and
supply of money as quantity of money times rapidity of circulation,
and where physical quantities are treated as the
relevant factor, no value concept of the sort here contended
for being presupposed. This is, essentially, Mill's method.
There is, in this conception, first the difficulty that "quan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>tity
of goods to be exchanged" is not a true quantity at all,
but is a mere collection of things of different denominations,
dozens of eggs, pounds of butter, gallons of milk, etc., incapable
of being funded into a quantity.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> There is, second,
the difficulty that increasing the amount of any one
of the items in this heterogeneous composite need not increase
the "demand" for money, in the sense that it increases
the "pull" on money, or tends to increase the supply
of money. Yet, under the general doctrine of supply and
demand, an increase in demand should be a stimulus to
increase in supply. Indeed, it is easy to construct a case
where an increase in the quantity of one of the items in this
composite, the others remaining unchanged, would actually
tend to <i>repel</i> money, to reduce the <i>supply</i> of money. Suppose
that one item in America's stock of goods, say cotton,
is much increased in quantity, and suppose that cotton has
a highly inelastic demand-curve, so that the increased quantity
sells for less money than the original quantity.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Suppose,
too, that cotton is our chief article of export, and that
the bulk of our cotton is exported. Would not the "balance
of trade" tend to turn against us, so that gold would
tend to leave the country, and the supply of money be reduced?
There is nothing in the situation assumed to raise
the prices of other goods,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> so that they could exert a coun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>teracting
"pull" on money. Europeans, to be sure, having
less to pay for cotton, could demand more of other
things, and Americans paying less for cotton could demand
more of other things. But, on the other hand, American
producers of cotton, receiving less for their cotton&mdash;receiving
precisely as much less as the others had more&mdash;could
then demand less of other things, exactly as much
less as the others are able to demand more. The original
tendency for gold to leave the country, and the tendency
for gold to leave the money-form and be used in the arts,
would remain unneutralized. An "increase of demand
for money," in Mill's sense, would in this case present the
remarkable phenomenon of driving money away. Physical
quantities are irrelevant. Psychological significances are
what count.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note, in this connection, that some
striking contradictions in quantity theory reasoning on any
formulation, whether connected with the notions of supply
and demand or not, are involved in this hypothesis. The
illustration above gives a case where a lowered price level
leads money to flow away from your country. But, on the
quantity theory explanation of foreign exchange, it is <i>rising</i>
price levels which drive gold away, and <i>falling</i> price levels
which attract gold!<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Mill's effort to apply the notion of demand and supply to
the value of money is, then, (1) not an application of his
formal doctrine of supply and demand, and (2), is a failure,
leads to results contradictory to the general law of supply
and demand, as soon as we take account of the peculiarities
of individual commodities, and cease to look at commodities
in one huge lump. Psychological forces, rather than physi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>cal
quantities, are what count. Whether or not the supply
and demand notion of Cairnes, reinterpreted by putting a
quantitative value concept into it, could serve as a means of
approach to the value of money, I shall not here argue. No
one so far as I know has attempted to do the thing that
way, and my own theory is best developed by another
method. It is interesting to note, however, another somewhat
different effort to apply the supply and demand formula.
General Walker does so, including among the factors
determining the demand for money, not only the
quantity of goods to be exchanged, but also the <i>prices</i><a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> prevailing.
Since by value of money Walker means merely
the reciprocal of the price-level, this is the clearest possible
case of a vicious circle. It would be a circle even if he were
trying to explain the absolute value of money, as distinguished
from the reciprocal of the price-level, since the
former is one of the determinants of the latter. Value of
money and values of goods determine prices; prices and
quantity of goods determine demand for money; demand
and supply of money determine value of money,&mdash;a hopeless
circle.</p>

<p>I know no sense in which the terms, demand and supply
of money, can have relevance to the problem of the value of
money. There is one sense in which the terms can be used
which fits in with the modern supply and demand-curves,
and that is the sense in which they are used in the money
market. Demand for money comes from borrowers; supply
of money from lenders. The price paid is a money-price,
the curves express the short time money-rates, the rental of
money, in terms of money, for stated periods of time. There
is a relation, later to be investigated, between the rental of
money, the money-rate, and the value of money, but the
two are in no sense the same. It should be noted, too, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
we are here concerned with "money-funds" rather than
with money in the strict sense,&mdash;distinctions and relations
in this connection properly belong at another stage of our
inquiry. Whenever the terms, demand and supply of
money, appear in the following pages, they will be used in
the sense developed in this paragraph.</p>

<p>Demand and supply are superficial formul&aelig;. They
cannot touch a problem so fundamental as that of the value
of money.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h3>COST OF PRODUCTION AND THE VALUE OF
MONEY</h3>


<p>When the cost theory was a labor theory, as with Ricardo,
the expression, cost of production of money, could
have a definite meaning. It meant the labor-cost of producing
the money metal. Even in this form, it is recognized
that cost of production has a looser connection with
value in the case of money than in the case of most commodities,
because the supply of money metal is large and
durable, and the annual production affects it slowly. But
cost of production theories, in the form of labor theories, or
labor-abstinence-risk theories, have little standing in modern
economic theory. Ricardo himself saw the break-down of
the pure labor theory; and Cairnes, Ultimus Romanorum,
so limited and modified the "real costs" doctrine as to
leave little validity in it, even on his own showing. The
prevalent doctrine of cost of production runs in terms of
"money-costs"&mdash;and hence is of no use when the problem
of the value of money itself is to be solved.</p>

<p>A brief historical sketch of the cost theory will be helpful.
Costs are sometimes conceived as a cause of value,
and sometimes as a measure of value. Often these two
aspects are mixed, and writers shift from one notion to the
other. This is particularly true of the labor theory. In
Adam Smith the contention sometimes is that labor is unvarying
in value, hence an admirable measure of values,
and an excellent standard of long-time deferred payments.
Smith compares wheat and silver from the standpoint of
the constancy of their relation to labor, and concludes that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
wheat is the better standard in the long run, because it remains
more nearly fixed with reference to labor than does
silver. Sometimes Smith thinks of labor as a cause of
value, and thinks of the labor that enters into the production
of a good as the significant thing. At other times, the
labor that goods will command or purchase is the significant
thing&mdash;and here one is not clear whether he thinks of
labor as a cause or as a measure. Whether labor is to be
funded as labor-pain, or as labor-time, Smith does not state.
Sometimes labor seems to be considered as homogeneous
in its efficiency. At other times, he makes comparison between
different kinds of labor as to their efficiency, and compares
the efficiency of labor in different occupations. One
can find nearly anything one pleases in Adam Smith on
these points. At times he speaks of "labor and expense,"
rather than labor alone, as governing prices.</p>

<p>Labor-cost to the laborer would take the form of labor-pain
or labor-time. To the employer, it would take the
form of outlay in wages. Adam Smith never makes any
definite statement of point of view here, and shifts back
and forth from one to the other. He recognizes variations
in labor-pain, in danger, etc., in different kinds of labor
when discussing wages.</p>

<p>Ricardo elaborated the labor theory of value, and tried
to think it through. He was too keen a logician to shift
view-points with Smith's facility, and he tried to make a
completed system.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> There is some shifting from the theory
of labor as a cause of value to labor as a measure of value,
as in the following passage: "If the state charges a seigniorage
for coinage, the coined piece of money will generally
exceed the value of the uncoined piece of metal by the
whole seigniorage charged, because it will require a greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
quantity of labour, or, which is the same thing, the value
of the produce of a greater quantity of labour, to procure
it." (<i>Works</i>, McCulloch ed., 213.) In general, however,
Ricardo developed a causal theory of value, quantity of
labor being the basis of the absolute values of goods, their
<i>relative</i> values depending on the relative amounts of labor
involved in the production of each. I shall not go into the
matter fully, but shall call attention to the rock on which
the system split, as Ricardo himself admits. A greater or
less proportion of capital works with labor in producing
different things, and the value of product, in that case,
varies not merely with the labor, but also with the amount
of capital, and the length of time the capital is employed.
How say, then, that labor alone governs value? How reduce
labor-cost and capital-cost to homogeneous terms?
James Mill tried to do it for him by making capital merely
stored up or petrified labor, which gives up its value again
in production. But this doesn't meet the difficulty, because
there is a <i>surplus</i> value, over and above that explained
by all the labor, including the labor which produced
the machine, and the labor which produced the raw
materials which entered into the machine, etc. The case
of wine is a particularly obstinate case. Wine increases
in value merely with the passage of time, at a rate which
corresponds to the profit on capital. Ricardo finally, in
correspondence with McCulloch, definitely abandons the
case, stating that there are many exceptions to the proportionality
between exchange value and labor-cost. "I
sometimes think that if I were to write the chapter on value
again which is in my book, I should acknowledge that the
relative value of commodities was regulated by two causes
instead of one, namely, by the relative quantity of labor
necessary to produce the commodities in question, and by
the rate of profit for the time that the capital remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
dormant." (Davenport, <i>Value and Distribution</i>, p. 41.) But
this is a "dualistic" rather than a "monistic" explanation&mdash;one
element is a money-expense, or at all events a pecuniary
item, while the other is a "real cost" item. The
two are incommensurate and incommensurable.</p>

<p>Senior seeks to supply the unifying principle. "Abstinence"
and labor have pain as a common element, and so
are commensurable. Costs, reduced to labor and abstinence,
become homogeneous again. Monism is restored.
Cairnes completes the doctrine by adding risk to the real
cost elements: a triune cost concept, sacrifice being the
generic fact in the three manifestations.</p>

<p>With John Stuart Mill, in general, we have an entrepreneur
view-point. Money-expenses of production, entrepreneur
outlay, plus wages of management, or including wages
of management, are the factors with which Mill reckons.
He is no longer concerned with psychological ultimates, or
real costs. Cairnes criticised Mill sharply for this. No
distinction is more fundamental he holds, than that between
costs or sacrifice on the one hand, and rewards on the
other. Labor, abstinence and risk are sacrifices; wages,
interest, profits are rewards. None the less, in cost doctrine,
as in supply and demand doctrine, it is Mill's view
which has prevailed. Cost as conceived by Mill is a superficial,
pecuniary notion. It tells little as to ultimate causation.
But it is virtually only as a pecuniary doctrine,
costs from the entrepreneur view-point, that the cost doctrine
is met in modern theory.</p>

<p>Why is this? Well, first, the real-cost doctrine simply
does not square with the facts. The hardest labor does not
produce the most valuable goods. Value in fact does not
vary either with labor-pain or labor-time. In fact, whatever
the explanation, it would seem to be truer that the relation
is an inverse relation. Nor does the abstinence that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
pinches hardest produce the largest amount of capital.
And while there is some correlation between risks and
profits, the correlation is at best low and is not a correlation
between psychological sacrifice and profits. Even
"marginal abstinence" for a Rothschild or a Rockefeller
causes no pain. It is absurd to seek to find a common
element in the "abstinence" of a rich man and the pain of
a poor and aged laborer. I pass over the supposed difficulty
that abstinence is, in general, suffered by one set of
minds, and labor-pain by a different set of minds, and
hence, since men cannot compare their own emotions with
the emotions of other men, there is no comparability. This
subjectivistic psychology would, of course, make it equally
impossible to fund labor-pains of different laborers, or to
get any common denominator at all.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> It is enough to point
out that differences between rich and poor, between successful
and unsuccessful, between efficient and inefficient,
(apart from acquired differences which may be smoothed
out by the "stored up labor-of-training" principle) make
labor-pain, and marginal labor-pain, vary greatly from
value, and make labor-pain, abstinence and risk quite
incommensurable, and quite without fixed relation to value.
Cairnes saw this in part, and developed his doctrine of non-competing
groups to deal with it. Labor-pain and value
vary together only when we are comparing goods produced
by laborers within a competing group. Laborers in one
group do not compete with laborers in another group.
There is perfect competition in the capital market, however,
and so capital costs ("abstinence") are perfectly
correlated with value, to the extent that capital enters.
Cairnes seems to think that the whole difficulty with his
real cost doctrine comes from the failure of competition.
In fact, however, it comes also from the inequalities in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
wealth. And even in his highly competitive capital market
it is equally true that abstinence, or even marginal abstinence
(a term which Cairnes does not use) has no constant
relation to amount of capital accumulated, value produced,
or interest received. The cost theory breaks down at every
point when it runs in labor-abstinence-risk terms. So generally
has this been recognized, that the cost theory has
generally given way to the utility theory, and cost doctrine
when it appears in modern economics is either the very superficial
money-outlay notion of Mill, or else the Austrian
cost doctrine, later to be discussed, which is still a pecuniary
concept. I have elsewhere undertaken to show (<i>Social
Value</i>, chs. 3-7, and the ch. on "Marginal Utility," <i>infra</i>)
that these defects of the "real-cost" theory, are just as
much in evidence in the utility theory. The failure of the
real cost theory of value is by no means a vindication of
the utility theory. Both have the same vice&mdash;the effort
to combine into a homogeneous sum a lot of individual
psychological magnitudes measured in money, when the
money-measure has a different psychological significance
for each individual, and so comparison and addition are impossible.
But in any case, the real cost doctrine of the
Classical School has failed, and so cannot serve as the basis
of the theory of the value of money.</p>

<p>Obviously the money-outlay cost theory of Mill cannot
explain the value of money itself. The marginal cost of
producing twenty-three and twenty-two hundredths grains
of gold will always be a dollar, however the dollar may
vary in value. Indeed, in general, the assumption of
a constant value of the money-unit is implied in the monetary
cost concept. Cost curves are <i>supply</i>-curves and the
reasoning already given as to the need for assuming constant
value for money in the supply and demand concept
will apply here. Costs function in value-determination only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
by checking supply. Rising costs tend to mean a lessened
supply. But if the cost-curve is rising <i>because</i> of a fall in
the value of money, then the demand-curve will be rising
also, and production will not be checked. The general
law as to the relation of cost to demand and supply assumes
a fixed value of the unit of cost, the dollar.</p>

<p>To the Austrian economists we owe a rational theory of
costs which gives the money-outlay concept more than a
merely empirical basis. First, they see in costs not causes,
but results. Value causation comes ultimately, not from
the side of supply, but from the side of demand. I shall
not now undertake a criticism of their explanation of demand.
I have elsewhere criticised their confusion of demand-curves
and utility-curves, and pointed out that
marginal utility gives no explanation of demand. I shall
recur to the utility theory of value at a later point. For
the present, it is enough to point out that the Austrian
theory of costs is independent of their utility vagaries, and
rests best on the notion of supply and demand, as expressed
in the modern curves, with the assumption of a fixed
value of the money-unit. Costs consists of entrepreneur
money outlay of various kinds, chiefly wages, interest, and
rent. Rent is, for the Austrians, as much a cost as any
other item of entrepreneur outlay. But these items of
cost are not ultimate data. They are rather reflections of
the positive values of the products. Value runs from finished
product to agents of production, labor, and instrumental
goods, and land. Avoiding needless complications
from a discussion of interest as a factor in cost&mdash;a doctrine
on which the Austrians, say Wieser and B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, are
not agreed,&mdash;it is enough to point out that high wages or
high rents, which limit production in any given industry or
establishment, are high <i>because</i> the land and labor in question
have <i>alternative</i> uses, because other industries, or other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
competitors in the same industry, bid for them. Cost-curves,
then, are reflections of demand-curves. The cost-curve
of wheat, <i>e. g.</i>, is what it is because of the demand-curve
for corn, for cattle, and for every other commodity
that could be produced with the same labor and land. Cost
doctrine thus becomes part of the general doctrine of supply
and demand, and runs in pecuniary terms, assuming money,
and a fixed value of money, and hence is incapable of serving
as a theory of the value of money itself.</p>

<p>That some vaguer form of cost doctrine, where the unit
of cost is, not money, but some composite commodity of
things used in the production of the standard money metal,
or a unit of abstract value, might be worked out, is doubtless
true. Gold production, like other industry, is part of the
general economic scheme, and there is some sort of equilibrium
reached which draws labor and capital now away
from, and now back to, the gold mine. To bring this
equilibrium into the general scheme of the modern theory
of costs, however, in terms precise enough to make a satisfactory
theory of the value of money, is a thing which has
not so far been done, and I do not have high hopes of its
early accomplishment. In any case, such a theory must
rest upon a positive theory of value. Cost doctrine is
negative, and can never be fundamental.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h3>THE CAPITALIZATION THEORY AND THE VALUE
OF MONEY</h3>


<p>Money is capital. A dollar is a capital-good. Money is,
moreover, a durable form of capital, which gives forth its
services bit by bit, and indeed, in a community where the
state bears the burden of wear and tear, never ceases to
give forth those services. In any case, from the standpoint
of a given individual, so long as there is a limit of
tolerance prescribed for legal tender, it is a matter of accident
if he ever incurs a loss from the wastage of the capital
instrument, money, through wear and tear. Moreover,
the fact that money is "fungible," and that its use is to be
found in a process which commonly returns to the owner,
not the same coin, but a different coin, we may, in general,
abstract from the wear and tear of the dollar, and look upon
the dollar as a capital instrument which promises its owner,
if he chooses to use it as capital, a perpetual annuity. The
nature of this money service will be more fully described
later. For the present it is sufficient to say that exchange
is a productive process, that exchange creates values, in as
true a sense as manufacturing does, and that money facilitates
exchange in as true a sense as coal facilitates manufacturing.
There is, at any given time, a demand-curve
for this money service, manifesting itself in the money
market, a demand for the short time use of money as a tool
of exchange, and the "prices" which come out of the interaction
of demand and supply in the money market are the
short time "money rates" including the "call rates."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
These are properly to be conceived, not as pure interest on
abstract capital, but as rents<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> which are to be attributed
to money as a concrete tool.</p>

<p>Now, in general, when such rents appear, they may be
capitalized. And the price of the instrument of production
that bears these rents, will be the sum of the rents,
discounted at the prevailing rate of interest, with considerations
of risk, etc., allowed for. The reasoning of the capitalization
theory is really quite simple. Take, for example,
a piece of urban site land, which is expected to
bring a perpetual annuity of one hundred dollars. The
whole economic significance of the land is contained in its
services, present and prospective. The possession of land
under certain circumstances brings other services, as social
prestige, than the services which can be alienated to a
lessee. But in this case I am abstracting from considerations
of that sort, and also from the factor of risk. The
whole value of the piece of land under consideration comes
from the value of the one hundred dollars a year. But
these annual incomes are not all equally valuable, even
though all expressed as one hundred dollars. The first
one hundred dollars is due one year hence, the tenth ten
years hence, the thousandth, a thousand years hence. The
principle of perspective comes in&mdash;I abstain from any detailed
discussion of the theory of interest, simply stating
that in a general way I agree with the contention that <i>time</i>
constitutes the essence of the phenomenon, or rather, the
tendency to discount the future. The capital price of the
land is the sum of an infinite convergent series of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
"present worths" of the incomes. The formula is as follows:
capital price of land = <small>$100/1.05 + $100/(1.05)<sup>2</sup> + $100/(1.05)<sup>3</sup> ... + $100/(1.05)<sup>n</sup></small>
when the rate of interest is 5%. The limit of this
series, assuming the series to be infinite, is $2000, and
a simple formula for calculating it under the assumptions,
is to divide $100, the annual income, by .05, the rate of interest.
Given the annual income, given the prevailing
rate of interest, the capital price is determined. The relation
may be illustrated, roughly, by the figure of a candle,
a disk, and the shadow of the disk on the wall. The disk
represents the annual income, the shadow on the wall the
capital value, and the distance between the flame and the
disk the rate of interest. Increase the distance between
the flame and the disk, the rate of interest, and the shadow
becomes smaller; shorten the distance, and the shadow is
increased. Similarly, enlarge the disk, and the shadow is
enlarged. The capital value varies directly with the annual
income, and inversely with the rate of discount. Now
my purpose here does not involve a detailed examination
of the validity or limitations of the capitalization theory.
For the present, the only question is, has this theory any
application at all to the problem of the value of money?
It offers itself as a general theory of the values of durable
bearers of income. Money is a durable bearer of income.</p>

<p>The capitalization theory, however, is of no use for the
purpose in hand. Money does not obey the general law in
the relation which the magnitude of the income bears to the
rate of interest. In general, the income and the rate of
discount are independent variables. Their influence,
operating in opposite directions, fixes the capital value, increasing
income increasing the capital value, increasing
discount rate reducing it. In the case of money, however,
the two factors are not independent. The short time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
money rate is not, to be sure, identical with the long time
rate of interest, which is the rate of discount for the purpose
in hand. But the two tend to vary together in the long
run average in fact, and they are related in the <i>expectation</i>
of those who are concerned in the capitalization
process.</p>

<p>In our chapter on the "Functions of Money," in Part III,
it will be shown that normally there tends to be a difference
between the money rates and the long time interest rates,
the long time rates tending to be higher than the rates on
short loans, the rate on very short loans being lower than the
rate on somewhat longer short time loans, and the call loan
rate being lowest of all. The explanation of this must be
deferred till we have analyzed the functions of money.
But the important thing, for present purposes, is that the
money rates, though lower than the "pure rate" of interest,
tend to vary, in long time averages, with that "pure rate,"<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
and that, consequently, the income from renting money,
and the discount rate to be applied in capitalizing that income,
are not independent magnitudes, but tend to vary
together. They thus tend to neutralize one another. If
money rates go up, and if they are expected to stay up long
enough to justify (on the ordinary capitalization theory) a
rise in the capital value of money, we have a counteracting
influence in the long time interest rate, which also rises, and
tends to pull down the capital value of money. To recur
to our illustration of the candle and the disk, as the disk increases
in diameter, the distance between the candle and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the disk grows greater, and so the <i>shadow</i> tends to remain
the same.</p>

<p>There is a further difficulty, to which attention will be
called more fully in later chapters, particularly the chapter
on "Dodo Bones," and the chapter on the "Functions of
Money." In other cases, in general, the capital value is,
as the capitalization theory requires it to be, a true shadow,
a passive function of the income and the discount, of the
disk and the distance between the candle and the disk.
In the case of money, however, the income is causally dependent,
in part, upon the capital value. Money can
function as money only by virtue of having value. The
shadow becomes substance in the case of money. It is the
<i>value of money</i> which makes possible the <i>money work</i>. The
capitalization theory, thus, if applicable at all, must be
radically modified before being applied. We shall subsequently,
in the chapters above referred to, take account of
this fundamental complication. For the present, we can
state it merely as a problem: how can we construe the interaction
of the income value of money and the capital
value of money in such a way as to avoid a circular
theory?</p>

<p>But further, the capitalization theory, as heretofore formulated,
like the doctrines of supply and demand and cost
of production, assumes <i>money</i>, and a <i>fixed absolute value</i> of
money. This assumption must be made if we are to be
able to predict, on the basis of the capitalization theory,
that a given annual income, at a given rate of discount,
will give a specified capital value. This may be shown by
the following considerations: If men anticipate that the
value of the income, which is a fixed sum of dollars, is to
grow less in the future, then the present worth of the bearer
of that income will shrink to an extent greater than the
"pure rate" of interest would call for. The principle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"appreciation and interest" comes in. The nominal interest,
in times of falling value of money, tends to exceed
the pure rate by an amount which compensates for the loss
in value of future income as the dollar falls in value. We
have here, however, a principle different from the principle
of time discount. It is not the influence of time, which
makes a <i>given</i> value appear smaller as it is further removed
in time, but it is an anticipated lessening in the value of the
income itself, that counts. In terms of our candle and disk
illustration, it is a factor affecting the size of the disk,
rather than a factor affecting the distance between the disk
and the candle. For the purposes of calculation, the two
elements in the nominal rate of interest may be lumped
together, and the nominal rate, rather than the pure rate,
may be taken as the rate of discount for capitalization purposes.
But for theoretical purposes, the two must be kept
distinct. The capitalization theory rests on the assumption
of a fixed value of the money unit.</p>

<p>That the fixed value of the money unit assumed is an
absolute value, and not a mere "reciprocal of the price
level," may be proved by some further considerations regarding
relations among these same factors. Assume a
fall in the rate of interest. Then, on the capitalization
theory, prices of lands, stocks and bonds, houses, horses,
and all items of wealth which give forth their services
through an appreciable period of time, will rise, and with
them the average of prices, or the general price level, will
rise.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> If one hold the <i>relative</i> conception of value, according
to which the value of money necessarily falls when prices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
rise, because the two are merely obverse phases of the same
thing, then this rise in the price level is, <i>ipso facto</i>, a fall in
the value of money. But we have seen that a fall in the
value of money means, on the "principle of appreciation
and interest," a rise in the interest rate! Hence, we would
have proved that a fall in the interest rate causes a rise in
the interest rate&mdash;which is absurd. If, however, we recognize
that prices can rise without a fall in the value of money,
if, <i>i. e.</i>, we use the absolute conception of value, this difficulty
disappears. The capitalization theory and the theory
of appreciation and interest can be reconciled only on the
basis of the absolute conception of value.</p>

<p>The capitalization theory, then, in its present formulation,
assumes money, and a fixed absolute value of money.
It is, therefore, inapplicable to the problem of the value of
money itself.</p>

<p>In general, none of the polished tools of the economic
analysis,&mdash;neither cost of production, the capitalization
theory,<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> nor the law of supply and demand,&mdash;is applicable
to the problem of the value of money. The reason is that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
they get their edge from money itself. The razor does not
easily cut the hone. It is to this fact, I think, that we owe
the widespread and long continued vogue of a theory so
crude and mechanical as the quantity theory. In the next
chapter we shall show that the utility theory of value&mdash;which
we shall not recognize as a polished tool!&mdash;has also
failed to give us help in explaining the value of money.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h3>MARGINAL UTILITY AND THE VALUE OF MONEY</h3>


<p>A good many writers have attempted to apply the marginal
utility theory to the value of money. Among these,
I may particularly mention Friedrich Wieser, Ludwig von
Mises, Joseph Schumpeter, and, in America, David Kinley,
and H. J. Davenport.</p>

<p>The marginal utility theory is ordinarily merely a thinly
disguised version of supply and demand doctrine. As
usually presented in the text-books, we have an analysis
of the phenomenon of diminishing utility of a given commodity
to a given individual, illustrated by a diagram, in
which the ordinates represent diminishing psychological
intensities. Often a money measure is given to these diminishing
intensities, and the curve is presented as the
demand schedule of a given individual. Then, with little
further analysis, a leap is made to the market, and it is
assumed that the market demand-curve, of many individuals,
differing in wealth and character, is a utility-curve,
and value in the market is "explained" by means of marginal
utility. I need not here repeat my criticisms of this
procedure.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> It gives simply a confused statement of the
doctrine of supply and demand. The analysis of utility
which precedes the discussion of market demand is wholly
irrelevant, and merely mixes things up. That such a
conception is of no use in solving the problem of the value
of money has been sufficiently indicated in the chapter on
supply and demand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes the contention is made that money is unique
among goods in having "no power to satisfy human wants
except a power <i>to purchase</i> things which do have such
power."<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> This contention, in Professor Fisher's view,
precludes the application of the marginal utility theory to
the problem of the value of money, and he makes no use
of marginal utility in his explanation. Indeed, in the passage
from which this quotation is taken, Professor Fisher
says that the quantity theory of money rests on just this
peculiarity of money. Not all writers who contend that
money has no utility <i>per se</i>, however, have felt it necessary
to give up the marginal utility theory as a theory of money,
as we shall later see.</p>

<p>On the other hand, writers of the "commodity school"
(or "metallist school"), writers who see the source of the
value of money in the metal of which it is made, can apply
the utility theory readily to the value of money, making
the value of money depend on the marginal utility of gold,
or the standard metal, whatever it is. To the writers of
this school, it is incredible that anything which has no utility
should become money. Money must be either valuable
itself, or else a representative of some valuable thing. The
value of money comes from the value of the standard of
value, and that value may, so far as the logic of the situation
is concerned, be as well explained by marginal utility
as the value of anything else. Typical of this view is Professor
W. A. Scott's discussion in his <i>Money and Banking</i><a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>,
though the emphasis there is not on marginal utility as the
explanation of the value of the standard, but on the value
(conceived of as an absolute quantity) of the standard as
essential to the existence of money, and the performance
of the money functions. Professor Scott attacks vigorously
and effectively Nicholson's exposition of the quantity the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>ory,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
where the assumption is made that money consists
of dodo-bones (the most useless thing Nicholson could
think of). Most quantity theorists would share Nicholson's
view that dodo-bones would serve as well as anything else
for money&mdash;or, to put the thing less fantastically, that the
substance of which money is made is irrelevant, that the
only question is as to the quantity, rather than the quality,
of the money-units, and the quantity of the money-units,
not in pounds or bushels or yards, but in abstract number
merely. For writers who seek the whole explanation of
the value of money in its monetary application, and who
see that money, <i>qua</i> money, cannot administer directly
to human wants, the view that Professor Fisher expresses,
namely, that money has no utility, and is unique among
goods in this respect, seems on the surface, to have justification.
On the surface merely, however. Money is not
unique among goods in being wanted only for what it can
be traded for. Wheat and corn and stocks and bonds and
everything else that is speculated in is wanted, by the
speculators, only as a means of getting a profit<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>&mdash;they are
remoter from the wants of the man who purchases them
than the money profit he anticipates. Ginsing, in America,
has value, though consumed only in China. And there are
people, particularly jewelers, who often want money as a
raw material for consumption goods. The difference is at
most a difference of degree&mdash;and of slight degree indeed in
the case of such things as bonds, which count on the
"goods" side of the quantity theory price equation, but
which really are in all cases remoter than money itself from
human wants. Money really stands, for the purpose in
hand, on the same level as any other instrumental good.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
does not give forth services directly, as a rule. Neither does
a machine, or an acre of wheat land, or goods in a wholesaler's
warehouse. Exchange is a productive process, an essential
part of the present process of production. Money is a
tool which enormously facilitates this process. It has its peculiarities,
no doubt. One of them is&mdash;and money is not
unique in this as will later appear&mdash;that it must have <i>value</i>
from non-monetary sources<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> before it can perform its own
special functions, from some of which it draws an increased
value. But there seems to me to be nothing in the contention
quoted from Professor Fisher, to justify setting money
sharply off from all other things, or to justify the view that
marginal utility is inapplicable to the value of money, if it
be applicable to the value of anything at all that is not
destined for immediate consumption. I do not believe that
the marginal utility theory is valid for any class of goods,
not even those for immediate consumption. Where marginal
utility theory is,&mdash;as in the conventional text-book expositions&mdash;merely
another name for supply and demand
theory, it is, as already shown, not applicable to the value
of money, and it is useful in the surface explanation of market-prices
of goods. But where marginal utility theory
really seeks to get at value fundamentals, it is precisely as
valid for money as for goods of other sorts&mdash;invalid, in my
judgment, in both places, and for the same reasons in both.</p>

<p>Among the writers who would apply the utility theory to
money, while still insisting that money, as such, has no utility,
are Wieser, Schumpeter&mdash;who accepts Wieser's theory
in its main outlines&mdash;and von Mises, who develops a notion
very different from that of the other two.</p>

<p>Wieser's doctrines are set forth in two expositions, separated
by five years, the second representing a considerable
development in his thought, though resting in part on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
first. The first is an address upon the occasion of his accession
to the professorship at the University of Vienna,
in 1904, and is published in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Volkswirtschaft,
Sozialpolitik und Verwaltung</i>, vol. 13 entitled, "Der
Geldwert und seine geschichtlichen Ver&auml;nderungen." The
second is a discussion, partly written and partly spoken,
"Der Geldwert und seine Ver&auml;nderungen" (written), and
"Ueber die Messung der Ver&auml;nderungen des Geldwertes"
(spoken), in <i>Schriften des Vereins f&uuml;r Sozialpolitik, Referate
zur Tagung</i>, no. 132, 1909. For the purpose in hand,
a brief statement of one or two points would suffice to show
the futility of Wieser's effort to get an explanation of the
value of money <i>via</i> marginal utility, but I think that readers
may be interested in a fuller account of Wieser's doctrine,
just because it is Wieser's, and so shall undertake to give a
more systematic account of it. For brevity, in the exposition
which follows, I shall refer to the first article as "I,"
and to the second as "II."<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>Wieser holds that it is possible to have money wholly
apart from a commodity basis (I, p. 45), citing the Austrian
<i>Staatsnoten</i> as a case in point. The reason for giving
them up is that they do not circulate in foreign trade. Gold
fulfills its international money-functions the more easily
because of its various employments, but, after it is thoroughly
historically introduced, as money, it could fulfill
its money functions even if all these employments be
thought away (46). Wieser gives no argument for this
contention, and its validity will be examined later.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> There
are, he says, two sources for the value of gold, the money
use and the arts use, interacting. Money is further removed
from wants, not only than consumption goods, but also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
than production goods, which are but consumption goods
in the seed. The latter are technically destined for definite
goods. But money may be used to procure whatever good
you please, in exchange. (The absoluteness of this distinction,
also, may be questioned. Pig iron is almost as unspecialized
as money in its relation to wants, since tools enter
into the production of almost every service that human
wants require, from surgical operations, through instrumental
music, to wheat and horse-shoes. On the other
hand, money is not the only thing by means of which other
things are purchased. The extent of barter in modern life
will wait for later discussion.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> I do not think that <i>any</i>
sharp distinction between money and all other things is
valid.) Wieser complains of the older economics which
treats money as a commodity. And he contends that as
money and commodities show a contrast in their essence
(<i>Wesen</i>), they should also manifest a contrast in the laws
of their values, even though the fundamental general theory
of value applies to both (I, 47). He finds in representatives
of money (<i>Geldsurrogate</i>) and in velocity of circulation of
money, factors which are lacking in commodities. (Again
a question must be interjected by the writer. Are not corporation
securities essentially like <i>Geldsurrogate</i> from this
angle? And do not goods vary greatly in the number of
times they are exchanged? What of the speculative markets,
where more sales are made in an active market, at
times, than there are commodities or securities of the type
dealt in in existence?) The value of money is essentially
bound up with the money-service. Wieser indicates that
he is not talking about the subjective value of money,
but its objective value, using the popular meaning of the
term, which, he says, is not strictly logical, but is useful: the
relation of money to all other goods which are exchanged,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the purchasing power of money. This depends on goods
as well as on money. In the second article, Wieser refines
and elaborates his conception of the objective value of
money, seeking to get away from the notion of relativity
which is involved in the conception of purchasing power,
and to get an absolute conception, which shall be a causal
factor in the determination of general prices, rather than
a mere reflection of them. It is to be a coefficient with the
objective values of goods in determining prices. A change
in general prices may be caused by a change in the value
of money, and may be caused by a change in the values
of goods (II, p. 511). In explaining this objective value
concept (which, in its formal and logical aspects, is in
many ways similar to the absolute social value concept
maintained by the present writer, though, in the present
writer's judgment, inadequately accounted for by Wieser,
so far as a psychological causal theory is concerned) Wieser
objects to the term, "objective value" which he had used
in the earlier article. He prefers "volkswirtschaftlicher
Wert." (This term is perhaps best rendered "public
economic value," for present purposes, to distinguish it,
on the one hand, from individual or personal value, and,
on the other, from the social economic value concept of the
present writer. At the same time, the connotation of a
communistic or authoritive value must not be read into the
term. It is, in its formal and logical aspects, really the most
common of all the value notions, and may, best of all perhaps,
be translated simply "value," or "economic value,"
or "absolute value." But for the present discussion, we
shall call it "public economic value.") This public economic
value, in the case of goods, is not a mere objective relation
between a good and its price-equivalent. It is a subjective
(psychological) value, like personal value. If one wishes to
call it objective value, one is using objective in the sense<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
of the general subjective as distinguished from the personal
individual idiosyncracy (II, p. 502). The objective exchange
value of goods (here Wieser uses "objektiver Tauschwert"
as the equivalent of his "volkswirtschaftlicher Wert" above
mentioned) is the common subjective part of the individual
valuations leaving out the remainder of individual peculiarities
("der allgemein subjective Teil der pers&ouml;nlichen
Wertsch&auml;tzungen mit Verschweigung des individual eigenartig
empfundenen Restes").<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Wieser does not seem to
me to think out clearly the distinction between absolute
and relative value in this connection. He wishes to get
something more fundamental than a mere relation between
goods and money; he wishes a psychological phenomenon.
He wishes to have a value of goods which can be set over
against the value of money, the two, in combination, determining
prices. And yet, he wishes somehow to get these
out of the prices themselves. "We must seek a concept of
the public economic value of money which, to be sure, proceeds
from the general price-level (<i>Preisstand</i>), but which
excludes from its content everything that comes purely
from the value of goods" (II, 511). To the public eco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>nomic
value of money, however, Wieser gives no independent
definition. The definition runs in terms of the values
of the goods. "The value of money rises when the same
inner values (<i>innere Werte</i>) of commodities are expressed
in lower prices; it falls, when they are expressed in higher
prices" (II, 511-12). "Inner value" of goods is not defined,
but I take it that Wieser uses it as meaning essentially
the same thing as the public economic value already
described&mdash;an absolute value. (<i>Cf.</i> the usage of
Menger and von Mises, <i>infra</i>, in this chapter, with respect
to the terms, "inner" and "outer" value.) The definition
is not strictly circular, perhaps, but at least it is pretty
empty. Nothing appears to give the value of money,
as distinct from its purchasing power, an independent
standing. The reason for this will later appear. It
should be noted, however, that the definition is not in
terms of prices or purchasing power. Prices might remain
unchanged, in Wieser's scheme, and yet the
value of money sink, if the inner values of goods should
sink.</p>

<p>The value of money, thus defined, is to be explained by
marginal utility. But money has no marginal utility of its
own, it has no subjective use-value, but only a subjective
exchange value,&mdash;derived from the use-value (marginal
utility) of the commodity purchased with the marginal
dollar (II, 507-8). This subjective-exchange value of
money is the personal value of money, as distinguished
from its public economic value, and is the cause of the
public economic value. The personal value of money
changes (1) with the volume of one's personal income, (2)
with the intensity of one's need for money, and (3) with
market prices. The personal value of money is directly influenced
and measured only in exchanges for consumption
goods. Expenditures of other kinds affect it only indirectly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
by leaving less for consumption expenditures. The laborer
always reckons with the personal value of money, but not
the business man, in his business calculations. As in the
case of goods, we pass from personal to public economic
value (II, 509). The personal value of money depends
on the relation between an individual's money income,
and his real income, in terms of goods. The public economic
value of money depends on the money income of the community
as a whole, and its real income. (II, 516-18).
Money income grows faster than real income, through the
extension of the money economy. Money income is not,
like real income, dependent on quantity. The mere extension
of the money economy increases the volume of money
income, lowers the personal value of money, lowers its
public economic value, and raises prices. Witness the effect
on a rural community of bringing it into the great market,
where all costs are reckoned in money and rising costs
compel rising prices. Hence, there is a tendency for the
public economic value of money to sink, and this has been
the historical fact (I, II, 519-520.)</p>

<p>Criticism of this theory is almost superfluous. There are
elements in Wieser's discussion, not here presented, which
have very considerable importance, and which will be
presented in a later chapter when the criticism of the
quantity theory is taken up. Wieser deals some heavy
blows to the quantity theory. But his constructive doctrine
presents the clearest possible case of the Austrian circle.
The value of money depends, not on its subjective
use-value, its own marginal utility&mdash;it has none. The value
of money depends on its subjective value in exchange, the
marginal utility of the goods which are exchanged for it.
But these depend on prices. And prices depend, in part,
on the value of money itself! This circle, present in every
form of the Austrian theory which seeks a causal explana<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>tion
of value and prices by means of marginal utility,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
though often less obviously present, is here quite glaring.
The distinction between volume of money income and
quantity of money is, on the other hand, an important one,
and will be emphasized when the quantity theory is taken
up.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> One further point in Wieser's doctrine calls for comment.
It is strange indeed to find an Austrian seeing in a
rise in money costs a <i>cause</i> of a general rise in prices.
The Austrian doctrine is rather that rising money costs
are <i>reflections</i> of rising general prices. Wieser's doctrine
that the extension of the money economy to rural
regions, compelling the farmer to reckon all his costs in
money and so to raise his prices, has been adequately criticised
by von Mises, who points out that Wieser sees only
half the phenomenon; that eggs and butter are, indeed,
higher in price in the rural region when it comes into contact
with the city, but that they are correspondingly lower
in the city from the same cause. On the other hand, the
doctrine of costs is not the whole point in Wieser's notion
of the extension of the money economy as a cause of higher
prices, and we shall deal with the doctrine again, in a
different connection.</p>

<p>By devitalizing the marginal utility theory, by stating
it in such a way that it makes no causal assertions, and in
such a way that it leaves the real value problem untouched,
it is possible to free it from the circle just pointed out.
Schumpeter does so state it.</p>

<p>Schumpeter's theory of value,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> though he attributes it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
to B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, seems to the present writer to be essentially
different. B&ouml;hm-Bawerk undertakes to explain the
value (objective value in exchange) of each good by its
<i>own</i> marginal utility to different individuals, buyers and
sellers of the good&mdash;indeed, by its marginal utility to <i>four</i>
individuals, the two "marginal pairs."<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> He sees at points
that the prices of other goods are sometimes factors, making
marginal utility give way to "subjective value in exchange,"
as the determinant of an individual's behavior toward a
given good in the market&mdash;as in his much discussed overcoat
illustration.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But B&ouml;hm-Bawerk never gets out of the
circle which this reaction of the market-prices on the individual
subjective values involves. Schumpeter seems to rise
to a higher conspectus picture, which, in form, avoids the
circle. His picture is that of a vast equilibrium, in which,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
instead of attributing the market value of each good to its
own marginal utility, you explain the exchange ratios<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> of
every good to every other good, all at once, by reference to
a total situation: <i>given</i> the number of goods of each class,
given the number of individuals in the market, given the <i>distribution</i>
of each class of goods among the individuals, given
the utility-<i>curves</i> (not marginal utilities) of each good to each
individual, an equilibrium will be reached, through trading,
in which ratios between marginal utilities of each kind of
good to each individual are inversely proportional to the
abstract ratios (ratios of exchange) between the same
goods, each measured in its own unit. The ratios are abstract
ratios, between pure numbers, so far as the market
ratios are concerned; the ratios in the mind of each individual
are concrete ratios, between marginal utilities.
The scheme, thus stated, says nothing as to the <i>causal</i>
relation between marginal utility and market ratios; it
merely states certain <i>mathematical</i> relations between each
individual system of marginal utilities on the one hand,
and the abstract market ratios on the other. By avoiding
<i>assertions</i> as to causation, it avoids a causal circle. In such
a situation, marginal utilities and market ratios are, in
reality, alike resultants, <i>effects</i>, of the given quantities of
goods, distribution of goods, numbers of buyers and sellers,
and individual utility-<i>curves</i>&mdash;not <i>marginal</i> utilities. To
this picture, one may add&mdash;what Schumpeter does not
add&mdash;the curves showing time-preferences of each individual
for each sort of good, and (an element which Schumpeter
does include) the curves of <i>dis</i>-utility for the individuals
who produce each kind of good. The system, it may
be noted, is as good a proof of <i>real cost</i> doctrine as it is of
utility doctrine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>Such a picture, I submit, avoids the circle which is presented
in all other formulations of the Austrian theory of
value. I wish, however, to indicate its limitations as a theory
of value, and the impossibility of any application of it to
the problem of the value of money. (1) Its data are inaccessible:
nobody could possibly know all the utility-curves
and all the time-preference curves (and disutility of labor-curves,
etc.) of all goods to all individuals in, say, the United
States. To explain market ratios by utility-curves is a case
of <i>ignotum per ignotius</i>, so far as practical application is
concerned. Moreover, the scheme is so difficult to visualize
that it is useless as a tool of thought&mdash;as one will find who
tries to think it through, without the aid of higher mathematics,
for ten goods, and ten persons, with unequal distribution
of wealth, and different utility curves, time-preference
curves, and disutility-curves for each kind of good
to each individual. (2) The scheme must assume smooth
curves and infinitesimal increments in consumption, which
is a fiction so far as the individual psychology is concerned.
Without this assumption, the point-for-point correspondence
between individual and market ratios does not exist.
It is only in social-value curves, or in demand-curves in the
big market (which are social-value curves, expressed in
money),<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> that you have, as a matter of fact, the right to
smooth out your curves. (3) The theory must assume the
frictionless static state, in which marginal adjustments are
perfectly accomplished, and equilibrium really reached.
Without this assumption, again the point-for-point inverse
correspondence of market ratios and individual ratios fails.
But this makes it quite impossible to apply the doctrine
to any functional theory of the value of money, or to bring
money in any realistic way into the scheme. As will be
shown more fully in later chapters, money functions in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
bringing about just the absence of friction which static
theory assumes. That is what money is <i>for</i>. The functional
theory of money, therefore, cannot abstract from friction
and dynamic change.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> It is, of course, possible, on this
scheme to pick out any one of the goods in the system, say
the 1-1000th part of a horse, call it the "money-unit," and
determine a set of money-prices. These "money-prices"
are already given in the scheme in the ratios between the
abstract numbers of this unit and the abstract numbers of
the units of all other goods. But this is meaningless, so far as
a theory of money is concerned. It abstracts entirely from
the <i>differences</i> in <i>salability</i><a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> of goods, on which the theory of
money must rest. It gives us no clue to that part of the value
of the money-article which comes from its money-functions.</p>

<p>(4) The theory has no bearing on the problems of supply
and demand. Demand-curves are curves, not of utility,
but of money-prices. They are concerned, not with a <i>system</i>
of ratios among goods in general, but with the absolute
money-prices of particular goods, one at a time. The modern
demand-curves and supply-curves, representing the
demand and supply doctrine first made precise by J. S.
Mill,<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> are concerned with the money-prices of particular
goods, and the "equation of supply and demand"&mdash;amount
supplied and amount demanded&mdash;gives an equilibrium in
which only one price is determined. Austrian theory, in
B&ouml;hm-Bawerk's hands, and in the hands of practically all
adherents of the Austrian School, including Davenport,<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
has been offered as really bearing on the explanation of
demand, and as giving a psychological account and explanation
of the demand-curve. The scheme of Schumpeter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
has simply no bearing at all on this vital point. The equilibrium
picture in which <i>all</i> goods are involved supplies no
data from which to construct any of the magnitudes above
or below the margin of the demand and supply-curves of
any given good. One reason why this is so will appear from
the point made with reference to "money-prices" in the
preceding paragraph. For Schumpeter's scheme, the significance
of the article chosen as "money" would be as much a
problem as anything else, when the conditions are laid
down. It would vary in the process of reaching the equilibrium.
Its ratios with all other things would, thus, fluctuate
until the equilibrium was reached. But, as we have seen,
in the chapter on "Supply and Demand," curves of supply
and demand must assume a fixed significance of the money-unit.
It may be further noticed, as marking off Schumpeter's
scheme from supply and demand analysis, that in
Schumpeter's scheme, the individual is the centre of interest,
and his reactions <i>toward all kinds of goods</i> is emphasized;
whereas in supply and demand analysis, the <i>good</i>&mdash;one
good&mdash;is the centre of interest, and the price-offers
streaming toward it from all kinds of individuals is emphasized.
The two bodies of doctrine are quite distinct.</p>

<p>(5) The theory has no bearing on the explanation of
entrepreneur cost&mdash;money-outlay, "opportunity cost," alternative
positive values, or what not. It finds no place
for the modern cost doctrine. It does not in any way open
the path to the Austrian theory of costs. Costs, for Austrian
theory, as, in general, for modern theory, are reflections
of <i>demand</i> for the employment of the agents of production
in alternative uses. Thus, it costs a great deal to
raise wheat in Illinois, because of the rival demand for the
land to produce corn. Labor costs are high in ordinary
manufacturing, because of the rival demand for labor in
the munitions factories, etc. As Schumpeter's theory can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
give no account of the <i>demand</i> for labor in the munitions
factories, it follows that it can give no account of the <i>cost</i>
of labor in the other factories. Instead, indeed, of giving
us the modern cost doctrine, we see Schumpeter's scheme
reviving the old <i>real cost</i> doctrine, running in terms of
sacrifices in production.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>(6) The foregoing paragraph gives emphasis to the point
with which we started, namely, that Schumpeter's theory
is not a <i>causal</i> theory, but merely a theory which gives
mathematical relations in a static picture. For the general
theory of the Austrians, this real cost doctrine is anathema.
Values are positive. The emphasis is put on positive wants,
as <i>causes</i> which guide and motivate industry. The <i>clue</i> to
all values is in the values of <i>consumption</i> goods, which are
in direct contact with the utilities which are the source of
value. From the values of consumption goods, we <i>derive</i>
the values of production goods, labor, etc., which are goods
of "second, third and fourth <i>ranks</i>" and whose values are
merely reflected from the causal marginal utilities of the
consumption goods they are destined to create. None of
this causation is brought into Schumpeter's conspectus
picture. On the contrary, with the bringing in of disutility
of production, we have the doctrine of the earlier English
School revived. The equilibrium picture is as good a proof
of the one theory as of the other. If we assume the utility-curves
constant, and allow the cost-curves to vary, then
causation would be initiated by the cost-curves.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>(7) Such an equilibrium picture leaves untouched the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
vital question which any theory must answer which means
to be of practical use in concrete situations: what are the
real <i>variables</i> in the situation, and what factors are constant?
What causes are <i>likely</i> to produce changes in market prices?
The individual-utility curves, which in Austrian theory are
commonly treated as the only variables, except quantities
of goods,&mdash;in the strict static picture there are no variables
at all!&mdash;are really, when conceived of as individual, as
growing out of the mental processes of each individual
separately, the most <i>constant</i> factor in the situation. For,
on the principle of the inertia of large numbers, each unit
of which is moved by its own peculiar causes, changes in
the utility-curves of one man will be offset by opposite
changes in the utility-curves of another, and so the general
system will remain much where it was. Of course, if a rich
man changes his curve, a poor man's change will not offset
it in the market, but this is to emphasize the <i>distribution of
wealth</i> rather than the utility-curves. It is only when you
get changes of a sort that the individualistic psychology,
and the "pure economic" explanation factors, of the Austrians
find no place for, that you can predict a change in
the general price-system. It is only changes in fashion or
mode, in general business confidence,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> in moral attitude
toward this or the other sort of consumption or production,
in the distribution of wealth, changes in taxes and other
laws&mdash;causes of a general social character&mdash;that you can
count on to produce important changes in values. Of
course, changes in the adequacies of supplies would be taken
account of on either interpretation.</p>

<p>(8) The scheme under consideration gives no value concept
which the economist can make any particular use of.
It gives only ratios between marginal utilities in the mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the same individual, and abstract market ratios. It
gives no <i>quantitative</i> value, which can be attributed to
goods as a quality,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> a homogeneous quality of wealth by
means of which diverse sorts of wealth may be compared,
funded, etc. Such a concept is, however, necessary for
the economic analysis, and Schumpeter is driven to creating
substitutes for it of various sorts, notably <i>Kaufkraft</i>
and <i>Kapital</i>. <i>Kaufkraft</i>, as Schumpeter uses the term, is
not derived from marginal utility, but is an abstraction
from the idea of money. It is not a quantity of money
alone, nor even of money and credit, but is a fund of "abstract
power," which depends not alone on the quantity of
money and credit in which it is embodied, but also on the
prices of goods.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> This <i>Kaufkraft</i> is needed to give the
causal "steam," the "motivating power," which the social
value concept connotes, but which ratios in the market
lack. Similarly, <i>Kapital</i> is conceived of as an agent, a
dynamic force, distinguished from accumulations of concrete
productive instruments, by means of which the
entrepreneur gets control of land, labor and instrumental
goods.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Other functions of the quantitative value are
shouldered on a hard-worked and unusually defined concept,
<i>Kredit</i>, which leads Schumpeter into certain "heresies"<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
regarding credit, which are mostly harmless in themselves,
but which will arouse misunderstanding and opposition.

and the social value concept, which covers by inclusion the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
notion of market ratio&mdash;market ratios being ratios between
social values&mdash;and which does all the work that Schumpeter
attributes to <i>Kapital</i> and <i>Kaufkraft</i>, and most of the new
work which he attributes to <i>Kredit</i>, is to be preferred,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> if
only on grounds of intellectual economy. "Capital" is
then saved for more usual meanings, and economy in terminology
is also effected. Schumpeter also departs, as
shown, from the abstract market ratio notion in erecting
a causal theory of value, in which "marginal utility" is
used as the equivalent of a quantitative value, and is traced
by the Austrian imputation process back to the original
factors of production. He even speaks of labor as having
"utility," whereas labor,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> unless used in domestic service,
has, not utility, but only value.</p>

<p>In the marginal utility scheme above outlined there is no
place for money, on the assumptions laid down. It is a
scheme of barter relations. The utilities which come into
equilibrium are not subjective-exchange-values, which, as
Schumpeter, with Wieser, contends, are the only subjective
values money has, but are real subjective use values&mdash;marginal
utilities. The scheme, assuming as it does, perfect
exchangeability of all goods, with infinitesimal increments
in consumption, has no place for money. There really is
no money service to be performed. Schumpeter, indeed,
speaks of money as a mere "Schleier," which does not
touch the essence of the phenomena, and such it is on his
assumptions. In a similar situation, Professor Irving
Fisher gives up the effort to find a psychological explanation
of the value of money,<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and offers the quantity theory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
as a mechanical principle, additional to the psychological
barter scheme. Schumpeter, however, does lip service
still to the need for a psychological explanation. His
answer runs in Wieser's terms&mdash;indeed, he attributes it
to Wieser. The <i>Preis</i> of money<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>&mdash;Schumpeter does not
use Wieser's absolute value concept, but lets his value of
money run in purely relative terms&mdash;the price of money in
goods depends on the subjective value of money. This
subjective value of money rests on the experience of each
individual in making purchases&mdash;rests on the prices of
consumption goods, determined by the relation between
real income and money income. The circle is as clear as
day.</p>

<p>Ludwig von Mises sees this circle, and tries to avoid it.
In von Mises there seem to me to be very noteworthy
clarity and power. His <i>Theorie des Geldes und der Umlaufsmittel</i>
is an exceptionally excellent book. Von Mises
has a very wide knowledge of the literature of the theory
of money. He has a keen insight into the difficulties involved.
He recognizes fully that, so far, the utility school
has failed to solve the problem (119-120). His theory is
as follows: Individual valuations (93) constitute the basis
of the objective exchange value of money. But while for
other goods, subjective use-value and subjective exchange-value
are different concepts, for money the two coincide,
and both rest on the objective value of money (94). This
seems to be our old circle in unmistakable form, but Mises
thinks he has an escape, as will later appear. No function
of money is thinkable which does not rest on its objective
exchange value. The subjective value of money rests on
the subjective use-values of the goods for which it can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
exchanged (95). Money, at the beginning of its money-functioning,
must have objective exchange value from
other causes than its money-function, but it can remain
valuable, even though these causes fall away, exclusively
through its function as general instrument of exchange
(111). He gives no argument in support of this contention,
but refers with approval to Wieser (<i>loc. cit.</i>), and to
Simmel (<i>Philosophie des Geldes</i>, 115ff.). Hence, the important
consequence that in the value of money of to-day
a historical component is contained. Herein is to be
found a fundamental contrast between the value of money
and the values of other goods (119-120.). The individual
valuation of money rests on the objective exchange value
of money of <i>yesterday</i>. This individual value of money
is the explanation, on the money side, of the objective
value of money of to-day. Going back, step by step,
you come ultimately to the subjective use-value of the
money-stuff in its non-monetary employment&mdash;a temporal
<i>regressus</i>. This opens the way to a theory of the
value of money based on marginal utility. This avoids
the circle of explaining the objective value of money of
to-day by the subjective exchange value of money of to-day,
which in turn rests on the contemporary objective
value of money.</p>

<p>I find this particularly interesting, since it employs a
device which had once suggested itself to me as a means of
escape from the Austrian circle, but which reflection led
me to abandon. I have discussed the whole matter in my
<i>Social Value</i>, and therefore venture a quotation from that
book.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>"How are we to get out of our circle:<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The value of a good,
A, depends, in part, upon the value embodied in the goods,
B, C, and D, possessed by the persons for whom good A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
has 'utility,' and whose 'effective demand' is a <i>sine qua
non</i> of A's value? The most convenient point of departure
seems to be the simple situation which Wieser has assumed
in his <i>Natural Value.</i><a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Here the 'artificial' complications
due to private property and to the difference between
rich and poor are gone, and only 'marginal utility'
is left as a regulator of values. But what about value
in a situation where there are differences in 'purchasing
power'? How assimilate the one situation to the other?</p>

<p>"A <i>temporal regressus</i>, back to the first piece of wealth,
which, we might assume, depended for its value solely upon
the facts of utility and scarcity, and the existence of which
furnished the first 'purchasing power' that upset the
order of 'natural value,' might be interesting, but certainly
would not be convincing. In the first place, there
is no unbroken sequence of uninterrupted economic causation
from that far away hypothetical day to the present, in
the course of which that original quantity of value has
exerted its influence. The present situation does not differ
from Wieser's situation simply in the fact that some, more
provident than others, have saved where others have
consumed, have been industrious where others have been
idle, and so have accumulated a surplus of value, which,
used to back their desires, makes the wants of the industrious
and provident count for more than the wants of
others. And even if these were the only differences, it is
to be noted that private property has somehow crept in in
the interval, for Wieser's was a communistic society. And
further, an emotion felt ten thousand years ago could
scarcely have any very direct or certain quantitative connection
with value in the market to-day. Even if there
had been no 'disturbing factors' of a non-economic sort,
the process of 'economic causation' could not have car<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ried
a value so far. It is the living emotion that counts!
Values depend every moment upon the force of live minds,
and need to be constantly renewed. And there would have
been, of course, many 'non-economic' disturbances, wars
and robberies, frauds and benevolences, political and
religious changes&mdash;a host of historical occurrences affecting
the weight of different elements in society in a way
that, by historical methods, it is impossible to treat quantitatively.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>"What is called for is, not a temporal <i>regressus</i>, which,
starting with an hypothesis, picks up abstractions by the
way, and tries to synthesize them into a concrete reality of
to-day, but rather, a <i>logical analysis</i> of existing psychic
forces, which shall abstract from the concrete social situation
the phases that are most significant. This method
will not give us the whole story either. Value will not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
completely explained by the phases we pick out. But then,
we shall be aware of the fact, and we shall know that the
other phases are there, ready to be picked out as they are
needed for further refinement of the theory, as new problems
call for further refinement. And, indeed, we shall include
them in our theory, under a lump name, namely, the
rest of the 'presuppositions' of value.</p>

<p>"Our reason for choosing a logical analysis of existing
psychic forces instead of a temporal <i>regressus</i>&mdash;instead,
even, of an accurate historical study of the past&mdash;is a two-fold
one: first, we wish to co&ouml;rdinate the new factors we
are to emphasize with factors already recognized, and to
emerge with a value concept which shall serve the economists
in the accustomed way&mdash;it is illogical to mix a logical
analysis with a temporal <i>regressus</i>. But, more fundamental
than this logical point, is this: the forces which have historically
<i>begot</i> a social situation are not, necessarily, the
forces which <i>sustain</i> it. The rule doubtless is that new
institutions have to win their way against an opposition
which grows simply out of the fact that we are, through
mental inertia, wedded to what is old and familiar. We
resist the new <i>as</i> the new. Even those who are most disposed
to innovate are still conservative, with reference to
propaganda that they themselves are not concerned with.
The great mass of activities of all men, even the most progressive,
are rooted in habit, and resist change. When,
however, a new value has won its way, has become familiar
and established, the very forces which once opposed it now
become its surest support. Or, waiving this unreflecting
inertia of society, as things become actualized they are
seen in new relations. What, prior to experiment, we
thought might harm us, we find beneficial after it has been
tried, and so support it&mdash;or the reverse may be true. The
psychic forces maintaining and controlling a social situa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>tion,
therefore, are not necessarily the ones which historically
brought it into being."<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Since the foregoing was written, I have found that another
theorist, Professor Alvin S. Johnson, had also given
consideration to the same idea, as a means of escape from
the Austrian circle. Professor Johnson refers to the notion
briefly in his review of <i>Social Value</i> (<i>Am. Econ. Rev.</i>,
June, 1912, p. 322), holding that the doctrine is logically
tenable, though rejecting it on psychological grounds.
"The value of a thing newly created can be explained only
with reference to values antecedently existing." That
there is a continuity in the value system, as in the whole
social-mental life of men, I should be the last to deny.
But it is not the antecedently existing values, <i>as</i> antecedently
existing, that give value to the new piece of
wealth. The antecedent values function only as <i>persisting</i>,
as <i>contemporary</i> social forces. We do not find the
motivating power of existing values in the ashes of burnt
out desire! It seems to me very essential to distinguish
the two methods of approach to the problem. It is possible
to state a historical sequence&mdash;if you know it,&mdash;showing
how values have historically come and gone. But for
an equilibrium picture, of the sort that our price theory
demands, where there is a mechanical balancing of contemporary
factors (as in Marshall's balls in the bowl illustration),
such an account is of no use. Existing social
forces have their history. But, at a given moment, they
are what they are, and what they <i>were</i> at a different time
adds no ounce of weight to the power they now exert. If a
quantitative account of value is called for&mdash;and price-theory
is essentially concerned with the measurement of
values&mdash;we must bring measure and measured into con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>temporary
balance. The historical account is one thing;
the cross-section analysis is another. "Static theory" is a
mechanical abstraction from the organic cross-section
picture, which, by making it superficial, is able to make it
exact.</p>

<p>It seems to me that this distinction must be kept clear
if progress in the science is to be made. At every point,
divergent conclusions are reached if the two view-points
are merged. The distinction between statics and dynamics
is, in a general way, the same as the distinction here made
between the historical and the cross-section view. It is
no answer to the Ricardian theory of land-rent for Carey
to point out that historically, in new countries, the uplands
are cultivated first, and the more fertile river-valleys later.
Ricardo is talking about statics, and Carey about dynamics.
Carey does not answer Ricardo, because he is talking about
a different problem. The utility theorist especially has
no right to leave the static view-point. All the elementary
laws on which the utility theory is based are static laws.
The law of satiety, of diminishing utility, is a static law,
and the utility theorists are careful to point out that it
holds only for an individual at a given time. It rests on
nerve fatigue. Give the nerve time to rest, and utility
does not sink. On the contrary, the dynamic law of wants
is that wants expand. As old wants are satisfied, new
wants arise, so that, in the course of time, <i>marginal</i> utilities
do not sink&mdash;the competition of new wants forces up the
margins of the old wants. Moreover, with time, tastes
change, habits are formed, and the same wants may grow
more intense&mdash;as in the case of olives or whiskey. All
this has been seen by the creators of the utility theory.
Thus, Wieser: "The want as a whole of course retains its
strength so long as a man retains his health; satisfaction
does not weaken but rather stimulates it, by constantly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
contributing to its development, and, particularly, by giving
rise to a desire for variety. It is otherwise with the
separate sensations of the want. These are narrowly
limited both in point of time and in point of matter. Anyone
who has just taken a certain quantity of food of a certain
kind will not immediately have the same strength of
desire for a similar quantity. Within any single period
of want every additional act of satisfaction will be estimated
less highly than a preceding one obtained from a quantity
of goods equal in kind and amount." (<i>Natural Value</i>,
p. 9.) A similar statement is in Taussig's <i>Principles</i> (I,
124), "In such cases, however, the tastes of the purchasers
may be said to have changed in the interval. At any
given stage of taste and popularity, the principle of diminishing
utility will apply." Illustrations could be multiplied.</p>

<p>It is true that <i>future</i> marginal utilities come into the
utility theory scheme, but they come in, not as future
utilities, but as "<i>present worths</i>" of future utilities, or as
"present anticipated feelings" in Jevons' phrase<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> suffering
a discount, usually, in the process. But I am not
aware of any writer among the founders of the utility
school, who has sought to bring past utilities into the
scheme. The past is dead. Its effects persist in the
present only in present processes. A <i>memory</i> is a <i>present</i>
psychological fact.</p>

<p>Consider further. Is it the prices of yesterday that determine
the subjective value of money to an individual, if
the prices of yesterday are different from the prices of
to-day, <i>and the individual knows it</i>? In so far as we have
the clear, intelligent economic mind, seeking its interests&mdash;and
the marginal utility theory assumes this type of mind&mdash;the
tendency is to bring all the factors in the problem into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the present. If prices change slowly, so that the individual
can count on essentially the same situation to-day that he
had yesterday, doubtless he will not take the trouble to
recast his value system. There is a tremendous lot of
trouble in bringing about, in the individual's mind, the
rational equilibration of values&mdash;trouble which the Austrian
theory commonly abstracts from, but which should be
recognized in the analysis, and accorded its own marginal
significance in the scale. To throw the emphasis on inertia,
however, and to assume that men do not readjust
their margins to meet changed conditions, is to depart
from the fundamentals of the Austrian theory. If the
price-situation is a rapidly changing one, men do rapidly
readjust their estimates of money. If money is fluctuating
rapidly in value&mdash;as, say, during a time when there is depreciated
paper money, whose future depends on military
events, the adjustments may be very rapid indeed. I
quote the following from the news columns of the <i>New
York Times</i>, of April 4, 1914, p. 2: "Jaurez, Mexico, Apr.
3.&mdash;After the hysterical outbursts last night that greeted
the news of the fall of Torreon, this city was preternaturally
calm to-day.... The silent gentleman with the
dyed mustache who spins the marble at the roulette wheel
in the Jaurez Monte Carlo, conducted by Villa's officers
for the benefit of the rebel treasury, seemed the only person
who was not excited. When the crowd of players suddenly
deserted him on the sound of the bugle call of victory, he
gave the marble another whirl from sheer force of habit,
but none returned.... In an hour, however, play was
faster and more furious than ever, for holders of Constitutionalist
money early realized that their currency had
suddenly increased in value, and that they were somewhat
richer than before." I do not question the fact, however,
that men are slow in making calculations, and that society<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
is often unconscious of changed conditions, and often readjusts
less rapidly than occasion requires. There is a
vast deal of inertia, of blind habit, of custom, etc. But
emphasis on these factors is not marginal utility theory!
Factors like these are emphasized by a functional psychology,
and by a social psychology&mdash;not by an individualistic
psychology which rests on the assumption of rational calculation.
It is not <i>past</i> utilities that explain present subjective
values of money when these subjective values are
out of harmony with the present market facts, but rather
<i>present</i> habits, present customs, present disinclination to
readjust, etc. There is a big difference, psychologically,
between the mental processes through which one arrived
at one's present state of mind, and the present state of mind
itself. The original "commodity utility" of the money
metal, in the far away time before the money use affected
its value, is surely no longer a factor. Certainly not on
the basis of an individualistic psychology of the Austrian
type. All the individuals who experienced that original
utility are long since dead! Not even memories of the
original utilities persist.</p>

<p>When writing the passage in <i>Social Value</i>, quoted above,
I did not suppose that I was dealing with a notion that
anyone else would ever take seriously. My purpose in
discussing it was chiefly to throw into sharp relief the contrast
between the historical and the cross-section viewpoints,
and to make clear that my own theory was based
on analysis of existing psychological forces. Since finding,
however, that two writers for whose views I have so
much respect have independently developed the same
idea, and have taken it seriously, I have felt it worth while
to give it this extended consideration.</p>

<p>Von Mises, like Wieser, needs an absolute value of money
in his thinking. He does not call the concept by that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
name, but, following Menger<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> speaks of the "inner objective
value of money" and the "outer objective value of
money." (Mises, p. 132.) The latter is the purchasing
power of money, a relative concept, exactly expressed in
the price-level. The inner objective value of money is designed
to cover the causes of changes in prices which originate
on the money-side of the price relation alone.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> This
inner objective value of money performs the same logical
function in the theory of money that the absolute social
value concept of the present writer does, even though the
psychological explanation lying behind it is very different.</p>

<p>Von Mises considers the quantity theory at length, noting
a number of defects in it, chief of which is the fact that
it has no psychological theory of value behind it, that it
does not account for the <i>existence</i> of the value of money, and
at most gives a law for <i>changes</i> in a value whose existence
is taken for granted. The details of this criticism, however,
need not be here presented. The quantity theory is to be
treated in detail at a later point of our study.</p>

<p>The writer who has most definitely stated the relation of
utility to the functions of money, is David Kinley (<i>Money</i>,
ch. viii). He would explain the value of money, by (a) its
utility as a commodity, and (b) its utility in the money-employment,
the employments reaching a marginal equilibrium.
The utility of the money metal in its commodity
use calls for no analysis. But what is meant by the utility
of money as money? Where the writers so far discussed
have denied that money as money has any utility, Dean
Kinley finds a utility in the money-function itself: money
facilitates exchange, and exchange, by transferring goods
from those who do not need them to those who do need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
them, increases the utility of those goods. Money, as
money, thus produces utility.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The utility of money is the
extra utility which comes into being by virtue of its use,
as compared with what would exist in a state of barter.
The marginal utility of money is the utility of money in
the marginal exchange&mdash;the exchange which would be
effected by means of barter if money were any more difficult
to procure. The marginal utility of money, then,
is not the whole of the marginal utility of the good for
which it is exchanged, but rather is the differential part of
that utility which is created by means of the use of money
in exchange. The marginal utility of money, thus, appears
in separate services of money. Money is a durable good,
which gives forth its services bit by bit. The value of
money is based on these separate services, it is "the capitalized
value of the service rendered in the marginal exchange."</p>

<p>This conception is, it seems to me, much truer to the
spirit of the general marginal utility theory than the
theories of Wieser, Schumpeter, or von Mises. If the
utility theory at large were valid, the application here
would be valid. To Dean Kinley's conception of a marginal
utility of the money service, I offer simply the objections
which I offer to the utility theory at large&mdash;objections
indicated in what has gone before, and in my <i>Social
Value</i>. The application of the capitalization theory to the
value of money I have already discussed in a previous
chapter, and shall again consider in the chapter on "The
Functions of Money."</p>

<p>I conclude that the marginal utility theory has not
solved the problem of the value of money. The reason,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
however, is simply that it has not solved the general problem
of value. The marginal utility theory, in so far as it
seeks to make marginal utility the <i>cause</i> of value, is circular.
The effect of a given man's wants upon the value of the
goods he wants depends, not on the marginal intensity of
those wants alone&mdash;a penniless prisoner may desire a
marble palace ever so intensely without affecting its value&mdash;but
also upon the value of the wealth possessed by the individual
who experiences the wants. But this is to explain
value, not by marginal utility alone, but by value as well&mdash;a
circle. Or, if we leave the standpoint of absolute values,
and look at the matter in terms of prices, the same situation
presents itself. The price which an individual is
willing to pay for a good depends on his income,&mdash;which
commonly rests on prices&mdash;and on the prices he has to pay
for other goods which enter into his budget. His price-offer,
expressive of the marginal utility of a horse to him,
is made with consideration of the price of a buggy, of
harness, of feed, of the wages of the servant who cares for
the horse, the price of a barn, and of the other things that
the possession of the horse involves. And not these alone:
less immediately, but still vitally, his whole budget enters.
Higher prices for theatre tickets or for food or for clothing
will reduce his price-offer for a horse. Further, his price-offer
for the horse will be tremendously influenced by his
opinion as to the permanent market price of horses. He
will not be willing to pay a price for the horse which he
cannot expect to get back if he should decide later to sell
the horse. The direct influence of market price on individual
demand-price is very great indeed. Marginal
utility (subjective use-value) very frequently gives place
to subjective value-in-exchange in the determination of an
individual's marginal demand-price&mdash;which means that the
market controls the individual instead of the individual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>controlling the market. With sellers, it is <i>generally</i> subjective-exchange-value,
rather than marginal utility, that
determines supply-price-offer. The sellers, in so far as
they are producers, have little need for the great mass of
their stocks. They will sell them, rather than keep them,
at almost any price. The reason they ask high prices is
simply that they think the market will give them the high
prices. The individual price-offers, in the aggregate therefore,
presuppose the whole market situation&mdash;presuppose a
general value and price system already fixed and determined.
Each individual price offer presupposes many
other prices, though not, of course, the whole market.
Since, then, much of the market situation is assumed in the
determination of each particular price, by the Austrian
method, it is obviously circular reasoning to think that the
determination of each price separately by this method will
supply data for a summary of the market situation as a
whole. In the one form in which the utility theory avoids
a circle,&mdash;that presented by Schumpeter, and discussed in
an earlier part of this chapter&mdash;it is not a causal theory.
Marginal utility is not a cause of market prices, but rather,
marginal utilities and market prices are alike resultants,
effects, of more fundamental factors. No writer<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> who
has presented the utility theory in this form has tried to
apply it to the value of money, and even if it could be so
applied, it would not give a causal explanation of the value
of money in terms of marginal utility. In most of the
efforts to apply the utility theory to money, the circle becomes
so obvious that one marvels that able theorists
should for a moment fail to see it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h3>THE QUANTITY THEORY OF PRICES. INTRODUCTION</h3>


<p>The quantity theory, in its usual formulations, is a theory,
not of the value of money, in the absolute sense of value,
but of the general price-level, the average price of goods
exchanged for money. It is not a psychological theory.
It does not deal with psychological quantities, or psychological
forces. It is a mechanical theory, concerned simply
with quantities, and the relations between them. The
essence of the quantity theory comes out in the following
brief statement: given a number of units of money; given
a number of units of goods to be exchanged; assume these
two numbers to be independent<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> of each other; assume all
the goods to be exchanged for all the money; then the average
price will be a simple function of the quantities of goods
and of money respectively, such that an increase in the
amount of money will increase the average price per unit of
goods proportionately, if goods remain unchanged in
amount, or an increase in goods will lower the price per unit
proportionately, money being assumed to remain unchanged
in amount. The qualification is commonly added that if
goods have to be exchanged more than once, the effect is
the same on prices as if there were an added number of goods
equal to the added number of exchanges, and that if money
is used more than once in exchanging a given number of
goods, the effect is the same as if there were proportionately
more money. Both quantity of goods and quantity of
money are commonly defined as actual quantity mul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>tiplied
by "rapidity of circulation." Rapidity of circulation,
however, for both money and goods, is commonly
thought of as a constant, so that the original formula
remains unaffected by the qualification, so far as a prediction
as to the effect of increase or decrease of money or goods
on prices is concerned. Involved in the quantity theory,
and explicitly stated by many writers, is the doctrine that
the substance of which money is made is irrelevant, that it
is the number, and not the quality or size of the money-units
that counts. "In short, the quantity theory asserts
that (provided velocity of circulation and volume of trade
are unchanged) if we increase the <i>number</i> of dollars, whether
by renaming coins, or by debasing coins, or by increasing
coinage, or by any other means, prices will be increased in
the same proportion. It is the number, and not the weight,
that is essential. This fact needs great emphasis. It is a
fact which differentiates money from all other goods and
explains the peculiar manner in which its purchasing power
is related to other goods. Sugar, for instance, has a specific
desirability dependent on its quantity in pounds. Money
has no such quality. The value of sugar depends on its
<i>actual quantity</i>. If the quantity of sugar is changed from
1,000,000 pounds to 1,000,000 hundredweight, it does not
follow that a hundredweight will have the value previously
possessed by a pound. But if money in circulation is
changed from 1,000,000 units of one weight to 1,000,000
units of another weight, the value of each unit will remain
unchanged." (Irving Fisher, <i>Purchasing Power of Money</i>,
pp. 31-32.) To the same effect is Nicholson's exposition,
in which the money is assumed to consist of dodo-bones,
the most useless substance that Nicholson could think of.
For the quantity theory, prices are determined by the
<i>numbers</i> of goods and dollars that are to be exchanged for
one another, and not by the <i>values</i> of the goods and dollars;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>&mdash;indeed,
for the quantity theory, "value" commonly has
no meaning apart from the prices which are supposed to be
adequately explained by the mechanical relations of numbers.</p>

<p>In the critical study which follows, virtually every doctrine
and every assumption of this preliminary statement
will be challenged. I shall deny, first, that the quantity of
goods to be exchanged and the quantity of money to be
exchanged for the goods, are independent quantities, maintaining,
rather, that an increase in either of them tends
normally to be accompanied by an increase in the other.
Quantity of goods and quantity of money <i>exchanged</i> are not
simple physical stocks, given data. Rather, they are consequences
of human choices and human relationships, and
vary from a large number of highly complex psychological
causes, many of which are common to both. I shall deny,
second, that "rapidity of circulation," either of goods or
of money, is a simple constant, independent of quantity of
goods or of quantity of money. I shall maintain, rather,
that rapidity of circulation of money is a phenomenon
which calls for psychological explanation: that the rapidity
of money really means the <i>activities of men</i>; that these activities
are complex, and obey no simple law; that instead
of being an independent factor, constant, in the situation,
the rapidity of circulation of money is bound up with the
quantity of money, the quantity of goods to be exchanged,
the rapidity of circulation of goods, and the prices of the
goods, and that the rapidity of circulation of goods is likewise
causally dependent on the factors named&mdash;or better,
on the causes which control them; that rapidity of circulation,
whether of money or of goods, is not a causal factor
independent of prices, but rather in part depends on prices.
In the third place, I deny the doctrine that the question as
to <i>what</i> the money-unit is made of is irrelevant. On the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
contrary, I shall maintain that the <i>quality</i> of money, rather
than its quantity, is the determining factor. I shall not
maintain that only money made of or redeemable in valuable
bullion can circulate, nor shall I maintain that the value
of money depends wholly on the value of its bullion content
when money is made of valuable metal. I recognize that
value can come from other sources. But I shall maintain
that value from some source other than the monetary employment
is an essential precondition of the monetary
employment, even though recognizing that that monetary
employment may, in a way later to be analyzed, add to
the original value of the money. The doctrine that only
physical quantities, or abstract numbers, of goods are relevant
I shall challenge especially, maintaining, on the
contrary, that the psychological significances, the values,
of goods are the really important thing, so that an increase
in the number of one sort of goods may have a very different
effect on the average of prices from an increase of the
same number of units of some other good, and so that an
increase in the number of goods exchanged under one set
of conditions may have a very different effect on prices&mdash;or
may be accompanied by a very different movement in
prices, for the question of causal relations is a complicated
one&mdash;from the change in prices that might accompany the
same increase in the amount exchanged of same goods
under other circumstances. Finally, the doctrine of the
quantity theory that the price-level is a passive result of
the other factors named: quantities of goods and money,
and their respective velocities; that prices cannot initiate
a change in the situation, will also be challenged. I shall
undertake to show that the first change in the situation
may appear in prices themselves, and that the quantities
of goods exchanged, and of money, and their velocities,
may then be altered to correspond with the change in prices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall further maintain, as against the whole spirit of
the quantity theory, that it does not seize hold of essentials
in the causes lying behind prices. I shall contend that
the factors with which it deals, instead of being independent
<i>foci</i> to which converge the causes governing the price-level,
and through which causation flows in one direction, are
really not true "factors" at all, but rather are blanket
names for highly complex and heterogeneous groups of
facts concerning which few general statements are possible.
Quantity of goods exchanged, for example, may be in some
of its parts caused by rising prices, in others of its parts may
be causing falling prices and is chiefly caused by <i>fluctuating</i>
prices. The net change in prices in this case is not the
result of any one movement from "quantity of goods"
as a whole. Changes in the price-level are not one result,
but rather, are the mathematician's average of many
changes, due to a host of causes, in many individual prices.
The quantity theory is an effort to simplify phenomena
highly complex. Of course, the simplification of complex
phenomena in thought is a laudable scientific goal, but when
the simplification goes so far as to group things only superficially
related, and to leave out the really vital elements,
it is worthless. Value theory, with all the value left out,
is like Hamlet with no actor for the title r&ocirc;le. Simplification
in the explanation of general prices has gone as far as
we can legitimately take it when we seek to summarize all
the factors involved in the <i>foci</i> of, on the one hand, the value
of money, and, on the other hand, the values of the particular
goods. The general price-level is an average of many
concrete prices. Each of these individual prices has a concrete
causal explanation. The <i>general</i> price-level has, not
a few simple causes, but an infinite host of causes. Indeed,
the general price-level has no real existence. It is a convenient
mathematical concept, by means of which we may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
summarize the multitude of concrete facts. It is useful as
a device for measuring changes in the value of money, on
the assumption that changes in the values of goods neutralize
one another. This assumption is never strictly true,
and often is demonstrably false. The general price-level
is neither a cause nor a result. Particular prices, in general,
are results of two causes, namely, the value of money and
the value of the good in question, and particular prices may
then become causes, changing the quantity of money involved
in a given set of exchanges. Neither quantity of
money, nor quantity of goods exchanged, nor rapidity of
circulation, nor general price-level is a simple, homogeneous
quantity, obeying definite laws.</p>

<p>I shall also undertake to show that in many important
cases the quantity theory leads to conclusions regarding
the price-level which contradict other laws of prices, notably
the capitalization theory, the cost of production doctrine,
and the law of supply and demand. I have previously
pointed out that these three doctrines are inapplicable
to the problem of the value of money itself. On the assumption
of a value of money, however,&mdash;using value in the absolute
sense&mdash;they are applicable to the problem of prices,
and, since the price-level is merely an average of particular
prices, they should be applicable to the problem of the
price-level also. It will be shown, in the course of the criticism
which follows, first that the quantity theory contradicts
each of these doctrines, in certain situations, and second,
that in these cases, the conclusions based on the cost
theory, the supply and demand theory, and the capitalization
theory are right, and the conclusions based on the
quantity theory are wrong. It has been maintained by
certain writers, as Knut Wicksell<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and Irving Fisher,<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
cost of production and supply and demand are inapplicable
to the problem of the general price-level. I shall maintain
the contrary, holding that while these doctrines are inapplicable
to the problem of the <i>value</i> of money, they <i>are</i> applicable
to the problem of general prices, on the assumption of
a fixed value of money. By the value of money I mean its
absolute<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> value, and not&mdash;what the quantity theorists
commonly mean&mdash;its "purchasing power," or the "reciprocal
of the price-level."</p>

<p>I shall undertake to show that no sound conclusion
reached on the basis of quantity theory reasoning is the
peculiar property of the quantity theory school; that every
valid conclusion which may be based on the quantity theory
may also be deduced from the theory maintained in this
book, and, indeed, that most of them may be deduced from
several other theories of money, notably the commodity
or bullionist theory. I shall show a number of false and
misleading doctrines which logically spring from the quantity
theory, and shall undertake to show that the quantity
theory fails to give an adequate basis for several important
parts of the theory of money, among them Gresham's
Law, the theory of international gold movements, and the
theory of elastic bank-notes and deposit-currency.</p>

<p>So much for the theses to be maintained. The detailed
proof of these contentions will best be given in connection
with a critical account of various versions of quantity
theory doctrine. Attention will be given in this summary
to the expositions of Nicholson, Mill, Taussig, and Kemmerer,
and very special attention to I. Fisher, though
some other writers will also be taken into account.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h3>DODO-BONES</h3>


<p>Must money have value from some source outside its
money-functions? It is a part of the quantity theory that
this is unnecessary. I have cited, in the preceding chapter,
Irving Fisher and J. S. Nicholson to this effect. Nicholson's
statement is interesting and picturesque, exhibiting
the quantity theory in all the nakedness of its poverty, and
I shall present it at some length. "For simplicity," to
isolate his phenomenon, he assumes a hypothetical market,
in which the following conditions obtain: (1) No exchanges
are to be made unless money (which he assumes to consist
of counters of a certain size made of dodo-bones) actually
passes from hand to hand. No credit or barter. (2) The
money is to be regarded as of no use whatever except to
effect exchanges, so that it will not be withheld for hoarding,
<i>i. e.</i>, will be actually in circulation. (3) There are ten
traders in the market, each with one kind of commodity
and no money, and one trader with all the money (one
hundred pieces), and no commodities. Further, let this
moneyed man put an equal estimation on all the commodities.
Now let the market be opened according to the rules
laid down; then all the money will be offered against all the
goods, and, every article being assumed of equal value,
the price given for each article will be ten pieces, and the
general level of prices will be ten. It is perfectly clear
that, under these suppositions, if the amount of money
had been one thousand pieces, the price-level would have
been one hundred per article, etc. Under these very rigid
assumptions, then, it is obvious that the value of money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
varies exactly and inversely with the amount put into
circulation.&mdash;The rapidity of circulation he regards as
co&ouml;rdinate, in fixing the price-level, with the volume of
money. To illustrate this, he assumes again his hypothetical
market, and "dodo-bones," assuming as before
that one merchant has all the money (one hundred pieces),
and that ten have commodities of equal value. Instead,
however, of the merchant with the money desiring all the
commodities equally, he is made to desire only the whole
of that of trader one, who in turn desires the whole of
number two's stock; and so on to the ninth merchant, who
wants the commodity of number ten, <i>who wants the dodo-bones</i>.
In this case, each article will be exchanged only
once, as formerly, but the money will change hands ten
times, and the price of each article will be one hundred instead
of ten. "We now see that, under these circumstances,
with the same quantity of money, and the same
volume of transactions, the level of prices is ten times as
great as before, and the reason is that every piece of money
is used ten times instead of once." Whence he concludes:
"The effect on prices must be the same when, in effecting
transactions, one piece of money is used ten times as when
ten pieces of money are used once."<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Ricardo, too, expresses the dodo-bone theory very explicitly.
"If the state charges a seigniorage for coinage,
the coined piece will generally exceed the value of the uncoined
piece of metal by the whole seigniorage, because it
will require a greater quantity of labour, or, which is the
same thing, the value of the produce of a greater quantity
of labour, to procure it.</p>

<p>"While the state alone coins, there can be no limit to
this charge of seigniorage; for, by limiting the quantity of
the coin, it can be raised to any conceivable value. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
on this principle that paper money circulates; the whole
charge for paper money may be considered a seigniorage.
Though it has no intrinsic value, yet, by limiting its quantity,
its value is as great as an equal denomination of coin,
or of bullion in that coin."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>Would the dodo-bones circulate? Nicholson chose the
illustration to throw into the sharpest relief the absence of
any value from a non-monetary employment. Nobody
has any use for them as dodo-bones. What economic
force is there, then, to make them circulate? Nicholson
says nothing about an <i>agreement</i> among the traders, <i>assigning</i>
a significance<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> to the dodo-bones, so that they might
function in the same way that poker chips do&mdash;indeed, any
such notion would vitiate his illustration, for he proposes
to explain an adjustment of prices by natural economic
laws. Why then, will any of the traders give up his valuable
commodities for the worthless dodo-bones? Will you
say that he will take them, not because he wants them
himself, but because he knows that others will take them
from him? But why would the others want them? Because
they in turn can unload them on still others? But
this seems a plain case of the vicious circle. It is, in effect,
saying that the dodo-bones will circulate because they will
circulate. A will take them because B will take them; B
will take them because C will take them, C because ...
N will take them; N takes them because A will take them.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
I do not deny that if the traders used the dodo-bones as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
counters, agreeing that such dodo-bones should represent
some other commodity chosen as a standard of values,
that the dodo-bones would circulate. But, in that case,
they would be, not primary, self-sustaining money, but
merely representative, or token money. And just here let
me lay down two general propositions<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> respecting the two
main functions of money: to serve as a standard, or common
measure, of values, the article chosen must, as such,
be valuable. The thing measured must be either a fraction
or a multiple of the unit of measurement. But this
quantitative relation can exist only between <i>homogeneous</i>
things. The standard, or measure, of values, then, must
be like the commodities whose values it is to measure, at
least to the extent of having <i>value</i>.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The second proposition
is respecting the medium of exchange. The medium
of exchange must also have value, or else be a representative
of something which has value. There can be no exchange,
in the economic sense&mdash;I abstract from disguised benevolences,
accidents, and frauds&mdash;without a <i>quid pro quo</i>,
without value balancing value, at least roughly, in the
process. Now when it is remembered that the intervention
of the medium of exchange, taking the place of barter,
really breaks up a single exchange under the barter system
into two or more independent exchanges, and that the
medium of exchange is actually received in exchange for
valuable commodities, it follows clearly that the medium
of exchange must either have value itself, or else represent
that which has value. These two propositions seem almost
too obvious to require the statement, but they contradict
the quantity theory, and they are not, on the surface,
reconcilable with certain facts in the history of incon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>vertible
paper money. It is necessary, therefore, to state
them, and to examine further some of the phenomena
which seem to contradict them. If they are true, Nicholson's
dodo-bones will perform neither of the primary functions
of money. They have no value, <i>per se</i>&mdash;they cannot,
then, measure values; they are neither valuable nor titles
to valuable things&mdash;they are not <i>quid pro quo</i> in exchange,
and will not circulate.</p>

<p>I shall not pause long to discuss the doctrine that money
needs no value itself, because it is really a sort of title to, or
claim on, or representative of, goods in general. The notion,
first, would not pass a lawyer's scrutiny. There are
no such indefinite legal rights. A system of legally fixed
prices, with a socialistic organization of society, would be
necessary to give it definiteness&mdash;and in such a situation
there would be no room for a quantity theory of prices!
Economic goods, as distinct from money, are not generally
"fungible" to the extent that would make them indifferent
objects of legal rights. Besides, whether or not the thing
is logically thinkable, it is legally false. Legal factors
enter into the economic value of money, as will later be
shown, but it is economic, and not legal, value, which
makes money circulate. Helfferich has taken the trouble
to give the notion of money as a mere title to things in
general a somewhat more fundamental analysis, and I
would refer the reader who is not satisfied by the foregoing
on this point to his discussion.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>I wish to make very clear precisely how much I mean by
the foregoing argument that circular reasoning is involved
in saying that A will take the dodo-bones because B will
take them. The same question arises for B, and for the
others. The real question is as to the cause for any general
practice of the sort. Why should A <i>suppose</i> that B will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
take them? What could bring about such a system of
social relations that a general expectation of this sort
could arise?</p>

<p>Kemmerer undertakes to give an answer in a hypothetical
case by the following ingenious assumption (<i>Money and
Credit Instruments</i>, p. 11): the money consists of an article
which formerly had a high commodity value, which has
lately entirely disappeared, but the money continues to
circulate, through the influence of custom, and because of
the demand for a medium of exchange.</p>

<p>In this illustration Kemmerer recognizes the historical
fact that money has originated from some commodity
which had value because of its significance as a commodity.
Historically, a great many different commodities have
served, and gold and silver finally emerged victors for
reasons which need not just now concern us. These historical
facts, coupled with the idea that value is, essentially,
"something physical,"<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> or coupled with the notion
that value arises only from marginal utility, or from labor,
have been accepted by the Commodity or Metallist School
as sufficient proof that standard money is only possible
when made of some valuable commodity. Professor
Laughlin seems to think of the whole thing as depending
on the value of gold bullion, and to recognize the money-employment
as a factor in affecting the value of money
only in so far as it draws gold away from the arts, and so
raises its value there by lessening the supply.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> If money
originated in a commodity, how is it possible for the commodity
value to be withdrawn, and for money still to retain
its value?</p>

<p>This brings us to a question I have raised before, namely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
whether the genetic, or historical account of a social situation,
and the cross-section analysis of the same situation,
necessarily agree.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Is it possible that when a commodity
basis was necessary to start the thing, and when even in the
modern world gold bullion, interconvertible with gold
coin, remains the ultimate basis of the money-systems of
all great commercial peoples, that you could withdraw the
commodity support and keep money unchanged in value?
Or could you even have any value left at all? Now in
answer, I propose to admit the possibility of so doing.
The forces which a cross-section analysis reveals are not
necessarily identical with those which a theory of origins
sets forth. Once the thing is set going, the forces of inertia
favor it. A new theory, fixed in the minds of the
people, say the quantity theory itself, might give them such
confidence in their money that its value might be maintained.
A fiat of the government, making the money
legal tender, supplemented by the loyalty of the people,
might keep up its value. I think there is reason to believe
that this is a source of no little importance of value for the
German paper money to-day, and, to a less extent, of the
notes of the <i>Banque de France</i>. All these possibilities I
admit. Value is not physical, but psychological. And
the form of value with which we are here concerned, economic
value <i>par excellence</i>, is a phenomenon of social, rather
than individual psychology. Many and complex are the
psychical factors lying behind it. Belief, custom, law,
patriotism, particularly a network of legal relationships
growing out of contracts expressed in terms of the money
in question, the policy of the state as to receiving the
money for public dues, the influence of a set of customary
or legally prescribed prices, which tie the value of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
money to a certain extent to the values of goods&mdash;factors
of this character can add to the value of money, and can,
conceivably, even sustain it when the original source of
value is gone. Social economic value does not rest on
marginal utility. In general, utility is essential, as one
of many conditions, before value can exist, even though
the intensity of the marginal want served by a good bears
no definite relation to its value. But in the case of the
value of a money of the sort here considered, marginal
utility is in no sense a cause of the value. Rather, the
marginal utility<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> of such money to an individual is wholly
a reflection of its social value, and changes when that
social value changes. It is quite consistent with the general
theory of economic value which I have set forth in <i>Social
Value</i>, for me to admit possibilities of this kind. The
value of money in such a case has become divorced from
its original presuppositions. The paper, originally resting
on a commodity basis, or the coins originally valued because
they could be transformed into non-monetary objects
of value, have become objects of value in themselves.
Analogous phenomena are common enough in the general
field of values, and are less common in the field of economic
values proper than one might suppose. Thus, most moral
values tend to become independent of their presuppositions.
Moral values of modes of conduct have commonly
arisen because those modes of conduct were, or were supposed
to be, advantageous in furthering other ends. Morality,
in its essence, is <i>teleogical</i>. Yet so far have the moral
ideals become ends in themselves that it is possible to have
great thinkers, like Kant and Fichte, setting them up as
eternal and unchangeable categorical imperatives, regard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>less
of consequences. Thus Fichte declares, "I would not
tell a lie to save the universe from destruction." Older
still is the dictum, "<i>Fiat justitia, ruat coelum.</i>" Yet truth
and justice, in the history of morals, and, in the view of
most moral thinkers to-day, are of value primarily because
they tend to preserve the universe from destruction,
and would never have become morally valuable had they
had the other tendency! Legal values manifest this tendency
even more&mdash;one needs only to point to our vast body
of technical rules of procedure in criminal cases, which persist
long after their original function is gone, and after they
have become highly pernicious from the standpoint of the
ends originally aimed at. In the sphere of the individual
psychology the phenomenon is very common. The miser's
love for money is a classical example. The housewife who
so exalts the cleanliness of her home that the home becomes
an unhappy place in which to live, is an often-described
type. The man who retires from business that
he may enjoy the gains for the sake of which he entered
business often finds that the business has become a thing of
value in itself, and longs to be back in the harness, while
many men, long after economic activity is no longer necessary,
continue the struggle for its own sake. Activities
arise to realize values. The value of the activity is derived
from the value aimed at. But consciousness is
economical, and memory is short. The activities become
habits. The habits gather about themselves new psychological
reactions. The interruption of habitual activities
is distasteful. Life in all its phases tends to go on of its
own momentum. The activities tend to become objects
of value in themselves, whether or not their original <i>raison
d'&ecirc;tre</i> persist. In both the social and the individual sphere,
apart from blind inertia and mechanical habit, active interests
tend to perpetuate the old activities, whose <i>raison<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
d'&ecirc;tre</i> is gone. The judge who continues to apply the outgrown
absurdities of adjective law may do it from timidity
or from being too lazy to think out the new problems whose
solution must precede readjustment to present social needs,
but the criminal lawyer who can free his guilty client by
means of these technicalities has an active interest in
their perpetuation. The individual who would readjust his
conduct in the light of changed interests finds that active
opposition is met in the emotional accompaniment of the
old habits. The economic society may wish to be free
from a money whose original value is gone, but there is a
powerful debtor interest which approves of that money,
and whose support tends to maintain its value.</p>

<p>All these possibilities I admit. My own theory of value,
which finds the roots of economic value ramifying through
the total social psychological situation, rather than in utility
or labor-pain alone, involves possibilities like these.
But&mdash;and this is a point I wish especially to stress&mdash;we
are out of the field of mechanics, and in the field of social
psychology, when we undertake to explain the value of
money that way. No longer is there any mathematical
necessity about the matter. There is no such <i>a priori</i> simplicity
as the quantity theory deals with. Factors like
these might maintain the value of money for a time, and
then wane. These factors might vary in intensity from
day to day, with changing political or other events, leading
the value of money to change from day to day, quite irrespective
of changes in its quantity.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In so far as you have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
a people ignorant of the nature of money and of monetary
problems, a people in the bonds of custom, with slightly
developed commercial life, whose economic activities run
in familiar grooves unreflectively, you will most nearly
approximate a situation like that which Professor Kemmerer
assumes. But that means that what might be true
in India, or to a less degree in Austria&mdash;countries to which
the quantity theorists are accustomed to refer&mdash;need not
at all be true in the United States. Here everybody was
talking about the theory of money in 1896&mdash;not necessarily
very intelligently!&mdash;and here, moreover, such phrases as
"good as gold," and propositions like that which came
from Mr. J. P. Morgan in his testimony before the Pujo
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>Committee that "gold is money, and nothing else," would
seem to indicate that a very great part of our people might
utterly distrust such a money as Professor Kemmerer
describes. The banker's tendency to look behind for the
security, to test things out, to seek to get to bed-rock in
business affairs, holds with a great many people. An
overemphasis on this is responsible for the doctrine of
Scott<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> and Laughlin<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> that the sole source of the value of
inconvertible paper money is the prospect of redemption,
and that inconvertible paper money differs from gold in
value by an amount which exactly equals the discount at
the prevailing rate of interest, with allowance for risk, for
the period during which people expect the paper money
to remain unredeemed. We have not the banker's psychology
to any such extent as that. Apart from the fact that
the money function adds to the value of money, under
certain circumstances,&mdash;a point to be elaborated shortly&mdash;other,
non-rational factors, contagions of depression and
enthusiasm, patriotic support, "gold market" manipulations,
etc., entered to break the working of the credit theory
of paper money as applied to the American Greenbacks.
I may here express the opinion that the credit theory is the
fundamental principle in the explanation of the value of
the Greenbacks, however. But we have not the banker's
psychology to any such extent as the extreme forms of
that theory would assume. "Uncle Sam's money is good
enough for me," is a phrase I have heard from the Populists,&mdash;who,
by the way, were pretty good quantity theorists!
"The government is behind it." There are plenty
of men for whom that assurance would be enough. Indeed,
the general notion that in some way, not specified,
perhaps not yet known to anybody, the government will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
do what is necessary to maintain the value of its money is
a ground which might well influence even the most sophisticated
banker. I think such a general confidence in the
English government has clearly been a factor in the price
of Sterling exchange since the balance of trade turned so
overwhelmingly against England in the present War.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
Our monetary history, I may add, has been in considerable
measure a struggle between these two opposing psychological
reactions on that point. The utter breakdown of the
<i>fiat</i> theory came in Rhode Island, and in connection with
the Continental Currency, in the days before the Constitution
was adopted. On the other hand, I do not believe
that those who put a banker inside every one of us can
prove that their principle has been a complete explanation
at any stage of our monetary history. But clearly considerations
like these take away all mathematical certainty
from the matter.</p>

<p>The foregoing analysis makes clear, I trust, that the
notion that the money function alone can make an otherwise
valueless money circulate is untenable. There must
be value from other sources as well. All that is conceded
is that there need not be a physical commodity as the
basis of the money. Value is not necessarily connected
with a physical commodity.</p>

<p>There is a disposition on the part of many quantity
theorists to beg the question at the outset, to assume money
as circulating, without realizing how much this assumption
involves. The assumption involves the further assumption
that there are <i>causes</i> for the circulation of money. But the
same causes which make money circulate will also be factors
in the determination of the <i>terms</i> on which it circulates,
<i>i. e.</i>, the prices. To seek then, by a new principle, the
quantity theory, to explain these prices without reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to these causes, is a remarkable procedure. There is sometimes
a disposition to do the thing quite simply indeed:
define money as the circulating medium, and, <i>by definition</i>,
you have it circulating! A rather striking case of this,
which is either tautology or circular reasoning, appears in
Fisher's <i>Purchasing Power of Money</i> (p. 129): "Take the
case, for instance, of paper money. So long as it has the
<i>distinctive characteristic of money,&mdash;general acceptability at
its legal value</i>,&mdash;and is limited in quantity, its value will
ordinarily be equal to that of its legal equivalent in gold."
(Italics mine.)</p>

<p>It is not quite easy to construct, even ideally, a social
psychology which would perfectly fit the quantity theory.
One would have to assume that money circulates purely
from habit, without any present <i>reason</i> at all. The assumption
must be that the economic life runs in steady grooves,
so that quantity of goods exchanged will always be the same,
or at least, that it will always be the same proportion of the
goods produced&mdash;there must be no option of speculative
holding out of the market allowed the holder of exchangeable
goods. The individuals must have constant habits
as to the <i>proportions</i> of the money they receive to be spent
and to be held for emergencies. All the factors affecting
"velocity" of both money and goods must be constant&mdash;Professor
Fisher maintains very explicitly that velocities,
both of money and of bank-deposits are fixed by habit
(<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 152),&mdash;and, in any case, the assumption is
necessary. A thoroughly mechanical situation must be
assumed, where there is the rule of blind habit. Given such
a mechanism, you pour in money at one end, and it grinds
out prices at the other end, automatically. But, strangely
enough, in this social situation where blind habit rules,
prices are perfectly fluid! In India, or in other countries
where the assumptions of the quantity theorist come most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
nearly to realization, so far as the general rule of habit is
concerned, one finds also many customary prices. In a
country completely under the rule of habit, the prices
would, as a matter of <i>psychological</i> necessity, be also fixed.
What might then be expected to happen in such a country,
if an economic experimenter should disturb them in their
habitual quantity of money? Which habits would give way,
those relating to prices, or those to velocities, or those
relating to quantities of goods exchanged?<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> I shall not
trouble to solve this problem, as it seems to me not the most
useful way to approach the problem of the value of money,
but I submit it to the consideration of advocates of the
quantity theory. My present purpose is accomplished in
pointing out the psychological assumptions which the
quantity theory makes: a psychology of blind habit, in a
situation where the price-level is free from control by customary
prices.</p>

<p>Now at another point I wish to mediate between the
quantity theorists and their extreme opponents. Representatives
of the Metallist of Commodity School&mdash;like
Professor Laughlin, and Professor Scott in his earlier writings&mdash;seem
to deny that the money-employment has any
direct effect in increasing the value of money. The money-employment
affects the value of money only indirectly, by
withdrawing the money metal from the arts, so raising the
value of the money metal, and consequently raising the
value of the coined metal. The quantity theory, on the
other hand, would utterly divorce the value of money from
causal dependence on the stuff of which the money is made.
Both these views seem to me extreme. Unless money has
value from some source other than the money employment,
it cannot be used as money at all. Nobody will want it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
On the other hand, the money use is a valuable use. Exchange
is a productive process. Money, as a tool of exchange,
enables men to create values. And you can measure
the value of the money service very easily at a given time
if you look at the short time "money-rates," <i>i. e.</i>, rates of
discount on prime short term paper. These are properly to
be considered, not interest on abstract capital, but the rent
of a particular capital-good, namely, money. The money
is hired for a specific service, namely, to enable a man to get
a specific profit in a commercial transaction. Money is
not the only good which can be thus employed, and which
is paid for for this purpose. Ordinarily a man will pay for
money for this purpose. Sometimes, however, one needs
the temporary use of something else more than one needs
money, and the holder of money pays a premium for the
privilege of temporarily holding the other thing. I refer
especially here to the practice of "borrowing and carrying"
on the stock exchange. The "bear" sells stock which he
does not possess, and must deliver the stock before he is
ready to close his transaction by buying to "cover." He
goes to a "bull" who has more stock than he can easily
"carry," and who is glad to "lend" the stock in return for
a "loan" of its equivalent in money. Ordinarily the bull
is glad to pay a price for the money, as it is of service to
him. Sometimes, however, the situation is reversed, and
the service which the temporary loan of the stock performs
for the hard-pressed bears is greater than the service which
the money performs for the bulls, and the payment is reversed.
When the bull pays a premium to the bear, for
the use of the money, the amount paid is called "carrying
charge," "interest charge for carrying," "contango," (London)
or (in Germany) "<i>Report</i>." This is the usual case.
But sometimes the bear pays the bull a premium for the
use of the stock, and the charge is then called "premium for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
use," "backwardation," (London) or "<i>Deport</i>" (Germany).<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a>
Money is, thus, not the only thing which has a "use" in
addition to the ordinary "uses" which are the primary
source of its value.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In the case of other things, however,
this kind of "use" is unusual. In the case of money it is
the primary use. The essence of this use is to be found in
the employment of a quantum of <i>value</i> in highly saleable
form in facilitating commercial transactions. Commercial
transactions, in this sense, are not limited to ordinary buying
and selling. I think it best to defer further analysis of
the money service to a later chapter, on the functions of
money, which will best be preceded by a consideration of
the origin of money. For the present, it is enough to note
that money has certain characteristics which enable it to
facilitate exchanges, and to pay debts, better than anything
else, and that this fact makes an addition to its value. It
is possible, I think, to measure this addition to value rather
precisely in certain cases. Thus, in the case of the American
Greenbacks, we find them at a discount, say from the
beginning of 1877 on, as compared with the gold dollar in
which they were to be redeemed in Jan. 1879. I think it
safe to contend that the country was practically free from
doubt as to their redemption after the early part of 1877.
The discount steadily diminished as the time of redemption
approached. Laughlin's theory is thus far beautifully
vindicated. The central fact governing the value of the
Greenbacks during this period was the prospect of redemption.
But, and here I think we see the influence of the
money-use, the discount was not as great as would have
been called for by the prevailing rate of interest, as measured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
by the yield on other obligations of the Federal Government,
at this time. And the discount completely disappeared
some little time before the actual redemption.
I see no cause for the absence of a discount in the
later months of 1878 except the additional value which
came from the money use. This additional value is, ordinarily,
not very great. And money is not alone in possessing
it. In extraordinary circumstances it may become
quite large. Thus, in 1873, in the midst of the panic, the
gold premium fell sharply. At this time the significance
of the Greenbacks as a legal tender, a means of final payment
of obligations (<i>Zahlungs</i>- or <i>Solutions-mittel</i>), as distinguished
from medium of exchange (<i>Tauschmittel</i>), attained
an unusual significance. In ordinary times, the
marginal value of this function of money sinks to zero, but
in emergencies it may become very great. In ordinary
times, during the Greenback period, uncoined gold bullion,
or gold coin used, not as money, but simply by weight
in exchanges, played an important r&ocirc;le, competing with the
Greenbacks in various employments, particularly as bank
reserves, and as secondary bank reserves, and so reducing
the marginal value of the money-employment of the Greenbacks
themselves. Gold bullion is not the only thing which
can thus serve, however. To-day, and generally, securities
with a wide market, capable of being turned quickly into
cash, without loss, or capable of serving as the basis of collateral
loans, up to a high percentage of their value, have a
much higher value, for a given yield, than have other securities,
equally safe, but less well-known and less easily
saleable. The "one-house bond" (<i>i. e.</i>, the bond for which
only one banking house offers a ready market) must yield
a great deal more to sell at a given price than the bond of
equal security which is listed on the exchanges, and has a
wide market. Part of this is in illustration of another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
function of money, the "bearer of options" function,
which enables the holder to preserve his wealth, and at the
same time keep options for increasing its amount when
bargains appear in the market. Foreign exchange performs
many of these functions of money in European
countries, particularly Austria-Hungary.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The notion that the whole value of gold coin rests on its
bullion content arises most easily in a situation where free
coinage has long been practiced, and where there are no
legal obstacles to the melting down of coin for other uses.
Where free coinage is suspended, the peculiar services
which only money can perform&mdash;or rather, the services
which money has a differential advantage in performing&mdash;may
easily lead to an agio for coined over uncoined metal.
The mere fact that coined metal is of a definite fineness
well known and attested is often of some consequence,
though the attestation of well-known jewelers may give
this advantage to metal bars as well, for large transactions.
But for smaller transactions, nothing can easily take the
place of money. A high premium on small coins, apart from
redemption in standard money, may easily arise from the
money-use alone. And standard coin may well attain,
in greater or less degree, a premium. If it is scarce, as compared
with the amount of business to be done, this premium
may well be greater than if it is abundant. But that
an indefinite premium is possible, or that this premium
varies exactly and inversely with the quantity, I see no
reason at all for supposing. If the premium be great enough,
men, especially in large transactions, will make use of the
uncoined metal&mdash;just as they did use gold in this country
during the Greenback period. The advantages of money
are not absolute. Money is simply more convenient for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
many purposes than other things. The possibility of a
premium is limited by the possibility of substitutes. It is
further limited by the fact that a high premium would
awaken a distrust which would bring the premium to
destruction, by destroying trade, and so destroying the
money-use on which the premium is based.</p>

<p>A detailed discussion of the Indian Rupee since 1893 lies
outside the scope of this chapter. I think it may be well,
however, to recognize at this point that the limitation in
the quantity of the rupee, through abrogation of free coinage,
was a factor in the subsequent rise in its value. It
was not the only factor, by any means. But it was a factor.
It may be also recognized as a factor in the value of Austrian
paper money.</p>

<p>The doctrine just laid down, as to the influence of the
money-use in adding to the value of money, is in no sense
the same as the quantity theory. For one thing, it is easily
demonstrated that the value-curve for the uses of money is
not described by the equation, <i>xy</i> = <i>c</i>. This curve expresses,
in terms of value, the idea of proportionality which is an
essential part of the quantity theory. Put in terms of the
money market, we have a demand-curve for money, not for
the long-time possession of money, but for its temporary
use&mdash;a rental, rather than a capital value, is expressed in
the price which this curve helps to determine. This curve
is highly elastic. When money-rates are low, transactions
will be undertaken which will not be undertaken when
the rate is a little higher. In the second place, the
method of approach is very different. It is not the
whole volume of transactions which must employ money,
but only a flexible part. In the third place, the money-use
is here conceived of as a source, not of the whole
value of money, but only of a differential portion of that
value. In the fourth place, the argument runs in terms of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the absolute value of money, and not in terms of the level
of prices.</p>

<p>It is not the legal peculiarity of money, as legal tender,
which is necessarily responsible for this agio when it appears.
In the first place, not all money is legal tender. In the
second place, we find the same phenomenon in connection
with "bank-money" at times&mdash;I would refer especially to
the premium on the <i>marc banko</i> of the Hamburg Girobank.
(<i>Cf.</i> Knapp, <i>Staatliche Theorie des Geldes</i>, p. 136.)
The legal tender peculiarity may, however, in special circumstances
be a source of a very considerable temporary
agio.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, to frame a hypothetical case in
which, barring temporary emergencies, the money-use will
add nothing to the value of money, and in which the whole
value of money will come from the value of the commodity
chosen as the standard of values. Assume that the standard
of value is defined as a dollar, which is further defined as
23.22 grains of pure gold. Assume, however, that no gold
is coined. Let the circulating money be made of paper.
Let this paper be redeemable, not in gold, but in silver, at
the market ratio, on the day of redemption, of silver to
gold. This will mean that varying quantities of silver will
be given by the redeeming agencies for paper, but always
just that amount required to procure 23.22 grains of gold.
Let us assume, further, that the government issues paper
money freely on receipt of the same amount of silver.
Assume, further, that the government bears the charges
which the friction of such a system would entail, by opening
numerous centres of issue and redemption, by providing
insurance against fluctuations in the ratio of silver to gold
for a reasonable time before issue and after redemption,
meeting transportation charges, brokerage fees, etc. In
such a case, the standard of value would not be used as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
money at all. It would have no greater value than it
would if it were not the standard of value&mdash;abstracting
from the fact that in the one case it might be used in its
uncoined form as a substitute for money more freely than
in the other. In any case, it would form no part of the
quantity of money. Its whole value would come from its
commodity significance. The value of the paper money,
however, would be tied absolutely to the value of gold. As
gold rose in value, the paper money would rise in value, and
vice versa. The quantity of money would be absolutely
irrelevant as affecting its value. The quantity of silver
would be likewise irrelevant. The causation as between
quantity of money and value of money would be exactly
the reverse of that asserted by the quantity theory. A high
value of money would mean lower prices. With lower
prices, less money would be needed to carry on the business
of the country. Paper would then be superabundant. But
in that case, paper would rapidly be sent in for redemption,
and the quantity of money would be reduced.<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> The
value of money would control the quantity of money.
The standard of value, which was not the medium of exchange,
would control the value of money, and so the level
of prices, in so far as the level of prices is controlled from the
money side.</p>

<p>In this hypothetical illustration, we have the extreme
case of what the Commodity or Metallist School seems to
assert. In this case, barring temporary emergencies too
acute to admit of increasing the money-supply by the
method described, their theory that the value of money
comes wholly from the commodity value of the standard,
would offer a complete explanation. I offer this illustration
as the antithesis of the dodo-bone illustration of Nicholson.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
That illustration sets forth the extreme claims of the quantity
theory, and purports to be a case in which the quantity
theory would work perfectly. The case illustrative of the
commodity theory clearly brings out the fact that that
theory rests on exclusive attention to the standard of value
function of money. The dodo-bone theory gives exclusive
attention to, but very imperfect analysis of, the medium
of exchange function. But I submit that the extreme case
of the commodity theory, in the illustration I have given,
is a thinkable and consistent system. It would work&mdash;even
though not conveniently. Indeed, it resembles in
essentials the plan actually proposed by Aneurin Williams,
and later by Professor Irving Fisher<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> for stabilizing the
value of money. Substitute a composite commodity for
gold, and gold for silver, in the illustration, and you have the
essentials of that plan. The dodo-bone hypothesis, however,
as I have been at elaborate pains to show in the foregoing,
is unthinkable. It would not work. It is, thus,
possible to construct a system for which the commodity
theory would offer a complete explanation. It is not possible
to do this for the quantity theory.</p>

<p>But the limiting case for the commodity theory is not the
actual case. Standard money is also commonly a medium
of exchange. Standard money is particularly desirable in
bank and government reserves. Its employment in these
and other ways is a valuable employment, and adds directly
to its value both as money and in the arts. There is a marginal
equilibrium between its values in the two employments.
The notion that the only way in which the money employment
adds to the value of money is an indirect one, by
withdrawing gold from the arts, so lessening its supply and
raising its value there, may be proved erroneous by this
consideration: what, in that case, would determine the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
margin between the two employments? What force would
there be to withdraw gold from the arts at all? Why should
more rather than less be withdrawn? There must be
ascending curves on both sides of the margin. Gold money
in small amount has a high significance per unit in
the money employment. A greater amount has a smaller
significance per unit. The marginal amount of gold put
to work as money has a comparatively low significance in
that employment&mdash;a significance just great enough to secure
it from the competing employments in the arts.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We conclude, then, that money must have value to start
with, from some source other than the money function,
and that there must always be some source of value apart
from the money function, if money is to circulate, or to
serve as money in other ways. But this is not to assert the
doctrine of the commodity school, that its value must arise
from the metal of which it is made, or in which it is expected
to be redeemed. Nor is it to deny that the money function
may add to the original value. On the contrary, the services
which money performs are valuable services, and add directly,
under conditions which we shall analyze more fully
in a later chapter on the functions of money, to the value
derived from non-pecuniary sources. Value is not physical,
but psychical. And value is not bound up inseparably
with labor-pain or marginal utility.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h3>THE "EQUATION OF EXCHANGE"</h3>


<p>In Professor Irving Fisher's <i>Purchasing Power of Money</i><a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a>
we have the most uncompromising and rigorous statement
of the quantity theory to be found in modern economic
literature. We have, too, a book which follows the logic
of the quantity theory more consistently than any other
work with which I am acquainted. The book deals with
the theory more elaborately and with more detail than any
other single volume, and sums up most of what other writers
have had to say in defence of the quantity theory. Professor
Fisher's book has, moreover, received such enthusiastic
recognition from reviewers and others as to justify
one in treating it as the "official" exposition of the quantity
theory. Thus, Sir David Barbour cites Professor Fisher
as the authority on whom he relies for such justification
of the theory as may be needed,<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> while Professor A. C.
Whitaker declares that he adopts "without qualification
the whole body of general monetary theory" for which
Professor Fisher stands.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Professor J. H. Hollander has
recently referred to Professor Fisher's work on money and
prices as a model of that combination of theory and inductive
verification which constitutes real science.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> The <i>American
Economic Review</i> presents as an annual feature Professor
Fisher's "Equation of Exchange."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Not all, by any means, of those who would call themselves
quantity theorists would concur in Professor Fisher's
version of the doctrine&mdash;Professor Taussig, notably, introduces
so many qualifications, and admits so many exceptions,
that his doctrine seems to the present writer like
Professor Fisher's chiefly in name. But there is no other
one book which could be chosen which would serve nearly
as well for the "platform" of present-day quantity theorists
as <i>The Purchasing Power of Money</i>. Partly for that
reason, and partly because the book lends itself well to
critical analysis, I shall follow the outline of the book in
my further statement and criticism of the quantity theory,
indicating Professor Fisher's views, and indicating the
points at which other expositions of the quantity theory
diverge from his, setting his views in contrast with those
of other writers. We shall find that this method of discussion
will furnish a convenient outline on which to present
our final criticisms of the quantity theory, and parts
of the constructive doctrine of the present book.</p>

<p>First, Professor Fisher presents in the baldest possible
form the dodo-bone doctrine. The quality of money is
irrelevant. The sole question of importance is as to its
quantity&mdash;the number of money-units.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> I shall not here
discuss this point, as a previous chapter has given it extended
analysis, except to repeat that it is in fact an essential
part of the quantity theory. If the <i>quality</i> of money
is a factor, a necessary factor, to consider, then obviously
we have something which will disturb the mechanical certainty
of the quantity theory. Professor Fisher is thoroughly
consistent with the spirit of his general doctrine on
this point.</p>

<p>Second, Professor Fisher has no absolute value in his
scheme. By the value of money he means merely its pur<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>chasing
power, and by its purchasing power he means
nothing more than the fact that it does purchase: the purchasing
power of money is defined as the reciprocal of the
level of prices, "so that the study of the purchasing power
of money is identical with the study of price levels." (<i>Loc.
cit.</i>, p. 14.) In this, again, Professor Fisher is absolutely
true to the spirit and logic of the quantity theory doctrine.
The equilibration of numbers of goods, and numbers of
dollars, in a mechanical scheme, gives prices&mdash;an average
of prices, and nothing else. Any psychological values of
goods or of dollars would upset the mechanism, and mess
things up. They are properly left out, if one is to be happy
with the quantity theory. Fisher, in discussion of Kemmerer's
<i>Money and Credit Instruments</i>, has criticised the
exposition of the utility theory of value with which Kemmerer
prefaces his exposition of the quantity theory, as
"fifth wheel." I agree thoroughly with Fisher's view in
this, and would add that the only reason that it has made
Kemmerer little trouble in the development of his quantity
theory is that he has made virtually no use of it there!
The two bodies of doctrine, in Kemmerer's exposition, are
kept, on the whole, in separate chapters, well insulated.
Coupled with this purely relative conception of the value
of money, however, there is, in Fisher's scheme, an effort
to get an absolute out of it: the general price-level is declared
to be independent of, and causally prior to,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> the particular
prices of which it is an average. I mention this remarkable
doctrine here, reserving its discussion for a later
chapter.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>A further feature of Professor Fisher's system, to which
especial attention must be given, is the large r&ocirc;le played
in it by the "equation of exchange." This device has been
used by other writers before him, notably by Newcomb,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>Hadley, and Kemmerer, receiving at the hands of the last
named an elaborate analysis. But Fisher, basing his
work on Kemmerer's, has made even more extensive use
of the "equation of exchange," and has given it a form
which calls for special consideration.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The "equation
of exchange," on the face of it, makes an exceedingly simple
and obvious statement. Properly interpreted, it is a perfectly
harmless&mdash;and, in the present writer's opinion, useless&mdash;statement.
It gives rise to complications, however,
as to the meaning of the algebraic terms employed, which
we shall have to study with care. The starting point is
a single exchange: a person buys 10 pounds of sugar at
seven cents a pound. "This is an exchange transaction in
which 10 pounds of sugar have been regarded as equal to
70 cents, and this fact may be expressed thus: 70 cents = 10
pounds of sugar multiplied by 7 cents a pound. Every
other sale and purchase may be expressed similarly, and
by adding them all together we get the equation of exchange
<i>for a certain period in a given community</i>."<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> The
money employed in these transactions usually serves
several times, and hence the money side of the equation is
greater than the total amount of money in circulation. In
the preliminary statement of the equation of exchange,
foreign trade, and the use of anything but money in exchanges
are ignored, but later formulations of the equations
are made to allow for them. "The equation of exchange
is simply the sum of the equations involved in all
individual exchanges in a year.... And in the grand
total of all exchanges for a year, the total money paid is
equal in value to the total value of the goods bought. The
equation thus has a money side and a goods side. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
money side is the total money paid, and may be considered
as the product of the quantity of money multiplied by its
rapidity of circulation. The goods side is made up of the
products of quantities of goods exchanged multiplied by
their respective prices."</p>

<p>Letting M represent quantity of money, and V its velocity
or rapidity of circulation, p, p&acute;, p&acute;&acute;, etc., the average
prices for the period of different kinds of goods, and Q, Q&acute;,
Q&acute;&acute;, etc., the quantities of different kinds of goods, we get
the following equation:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
MV = pQ + p&acute;Q&acute; + p&acute;&acute;Q&acute;&acute; + etc.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a><br />
</p></div>

<p>"The right-hand side of this equation is the sum of terms of
the form pQ&mdash;a price multiplied by the quantity bought."<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
The equation may then be written,</p>

<p>MV = &#931; pQ (Sigma being the symbol of summation).
The equation is further simplified<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> by rewriting the right-hand
side as PT, where P is the weighted <i>average</i> of all the
p's, and T is the <i>sum</i> of all the Q's. "P then represents in
one magnitude the level of prices, and T represents in one
magnitude the volume of trade."</p>

<p>It may seem like captious triviality to raise questions and
objections thus early in the exposition of Professor Fisher's
doctrine. And yet, serious questions are to be raised.
First, in what sense is there an equality between the ten
pounds of sugar and the seventy cents? Equality exists
only between <i>homogeneous</i> things. In what sense are
money and sugar homogeneous? From my own standpoint,
the answer is easy: money and sugar are alike in
that both are <i>valuable</i>, both possess the attribute of economic
social value, an absolute quality and quantity. The
degree in which each possesses this quality determines
the exchange relation between them. And the degree in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
which each other good possesses this quality, taken in conjunction
with the value of money, determines every other
particular price. Finally, an average of these particular
prices, each determined in this way, gives us the general
price-level. The value of the money, on the one hand,
and the values of the goods on the other hand, are both to
be explained as complex social psychological forces. But
when this method of approach is used, when prices are
conceived of as the results of organic social psychological
forces, there is no room for, or occasion for, a further explanation
in terms of the mechanical equilibration of goods
and money. Professor Fisher, as just shown, very carefully
excludes this and all other psychological approaches
to his problem of general prices, and has no place in his
system for an absolute value. In what sense, then, are
the sugar and the money equal? Professor Fisher says
(p. 17), that the equation is an equation of values. But
what does he mean by values in this connection? Perhaps
a further question may show what he <i>must</i> mean, if his
equation is to be intelligible. That question is regarding
the meaning of T.</p>

<p>T, in Professor Fisher's equation, is defined as the sum
of all the Q's. But how does one sum up <i>pounds</i> of <i>sugar</i>,
<i>loaves</i> of <i>bread</i>, <i>tons</i> of <i>coal</i>, <i>yards</i> of <i>cloth</i>, etc.? I find at
only one place in Professor Fisher's book an effort to answer
that question, and there it is not clear that he means to
give a general answer. He needs units of Q which shall be
homogeneous when he undertakes to put concrete figures
into his equation for the purpose of comparing index numbers
and equations for successive years. "If we now add
together these tons, pounds, bushels, etc., and call this
grand total so many 'units' of commodity, we shall have
a very arbitrary summation. It will make a difference,
for instance, whether we measure coal by tons or hundred-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>weights.
The system becomes less arbitrary if we use, as
the unit for measuring any goods, not the unit in which it
is commonly sold, but the amount which constitutes a
'dollar's worth' at some particular year called the base
year" (p. 196). If this be merely a device for the purpose
of handling index numbers, a convention to aid mensuration,
we need not, perhaps, challenge it. The unit chosen
is, in that case, after all a fixed physical quantity of goods,
the amount bought with a dollar in a given year, and remains
fixed as the prices vary in subsequent years. That
it is more "philosophical" or less "arbitrary" than the
more common units is not clear, but, if it be an answer, designed
merely for the particular purpose, and not a general
answer, it is aside from my purpose to criticise it here.
If, however, this is Professor Fisher's <i>general</i> answer to the
question of the method of summing up T, if it is to be employed
in his equation when the question of <i>causation</i>, as
distinguished from <i>mensuration</i>, is involved, then it represents
a vicious circle. If T involves the price-level in its
definition, then T cannot be used as a causal factor to explain
the price-level. I shall not undertake to give an
answer, where Professor Fisher himself fails to give one,
as to his meaning. I simply point out that he himself
recognizes that the summation of the Q's is arbitrary without
a common unit, and that the only common unit suggested
in his book, if applied generally, involves a vicious
circle.</p>

<p>What, then, is T? Perhaps another question will aid
us in answering this. What does it mean to <i>multiply</i> ten
pounds of sugar by seven cents? What sort of product
results? Is the answer seventy pounds of sugar, or seventy
cents, or some new two-dimensional hybrid? One multiplies
feet by feet to get <i>square</i> feet, and square feet by
feet to get cubic feet. But in general, the multiplication<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
of <i>concrete</i> quantities by <i>concrete</i> quantities is meaningless.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
One of the generalizations of elementary arithmetic is that
concrete quantities may usually be multiplied, not by other
concrete quantities, but rather by <i>abstract</i> quantities, pure
numbers. Then the product has meaning: it is a concrete
quantity of the same denomination as the multiplicand.
If the Q's, then, are to be multiplied by their respective
p's, the Q's must be interpreted, not as bushels or pounds
or yards of concrete goods, but merely as abstract numbers.
And T must be, not a sum of concrete goods, but a sum of
abstract numbers, and so itself an abstract number. Thus
interpreted, T is equally increased by adding a hundred
papers of pins,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> a hundred diamonds, a hundred tons of
copper, or a hundred newspapers. This is not Professor
Fisher's rendering of T, but it is the only rendering which
makes an intelligible equation.</p>

<p>We return, then, to the question with which we set out:
in what sense is there an equality between the two sides of
Professor Fisher's equation? The answer is as follows:
on one side of the equation we have M, a quantity of money,
multiplied by V, an abstract number; on the other side of
the equation, we have P, a quantity of money, multiplied
by T, an abstract number. The product, on each side, is
a <i>sum of money</i>. These sums are equal. They are equal
because they are <i>identical</i>. The equation asserts merely
that what is <i>paid</i> is equal to what is <i>received</i>. This proposition
may require algebraic formulation, but to the present
writer it does not seem to require any formulation at all.
The contrast between the "money side" and the "goods
side" of the equation is a false one. There is no goods side.
Both sides of the equation are money sides. I repeat that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
this is not Professor Fisher's interpretation of his equation.
But it seems the only interpretation which is defensible.</p>

<p>A further point must be made: Sigma pQ, where the Q's
are interpreted as abstract numbers, is a summary of concrete
money payments, each of which has a causal explanation,
and each of which has effected a concrete exchange.
Mathematically, PT is equal to &#931;pQ, just as 3 times 4
is equal to 2 times 6. But from the standpoint of the
theory of causation, a vast difference is made. Three
children four feet high equal in aggregate height two men
six feet high. But the assertion of equality between the
three children and the two men represents a high degree
of abstraction, and need not be significant for any given
purpose. Similarly, the restatement of &#931;pQ as PT. One
might restate &#931;pQ as PT, defining P as the <i>sum</i> (instead of
the average) of the p's, and T as the weighted average (instead
of the sum) of the Q's. Such a substitution would
be equally legitimate, mathematically, and the equation,
MV = PT equally true. &#931;pQ might be factorized in an
indefinite number of ways. But it is important to note
that in PT, as defined by Professor Fisher,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> we are at three
removes from the concrete exchanges in which actual concrete
causation is focused: we have first taken, for each commodity,
an average, for a period, say a year, of the concrete
prices paid for a unit of that commodity, and multiplied that
average by the abstract number of units of that commodity
sold in that year; we have then summed up all these
products into a giant aggregate, in which we have mingled
hopelessly a mass of concrete causes which actually affected
the particular prices; then, finally, we have factorized this
giant composite into two numbers which have no concrete
reality, namely, an average of the averages of the prices, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
a sum of the abstract numbers of the sums of the goods of
each kind sold in a given year&mdash;a sum which exists only as a
pure number, and which, consequently, is unlikely to be a
causal factor! It may turn out that there is reason for all
this, but if a <i>causal</i> theory is the object for which the equation
of exchange is designed, a strong presumption against
its usefulness is raised. Both P and T are so highly abstract
that it is improbable that any significant statements can
be made of either of them. As concepts gain in generality
and abstractness, they lose in content; as they gain in
"extension" they lose (as a rule) in "intension." On the
other side of the equation, we also look in vain for a truly
concrete factor. V, the average velocity of money for the
year, is highly abstract. It is a mathematical summary
of a host of complex activities of men. Professor Fisher
thinks that V obeys fairly simple laws, as we shall later see,
but at least that point must be demonstrated. Even M
is not concrete. At a given moment, the money in circulation
is a concrete quantity, but the average for the year is
abstract, and cannot claim to be a direct causal factor,
with one uniform tendency. Of course Professor Fisher
himself recognizes that his central problem is, not to state
and justify, mathematically, his equation<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>&mdash;that is a work
of supererogation, and the statistical chapters devoted to
it seem to me to be largely wasted labor. Professor
Fisher recognizes that his central problem is to establish
<i>causal</i> relations among the factors in his equation of exchange.
It is from the standpoint of its adaptability as a
tool in a theory of causation that I have been considering
it. It should be noted that "volume of trade," as frequently
used, means not numbers of goods sold, but the
money-price of all the goods exchanged, or PT. It is in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
this sense of "trade" that bank-clearings are supposed to
be an index of volume of trade. The sundering of the p's
and Q's really is a big assumption of many of the points at
issue. Indeed, it is absolutely impossible to sunder PT.
It is always the p aspect of the thing that is significant,
Fisher himself finally interprets T, statistically, as billions
of <i>dollars</i>.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> As a matter of mathematical necessity, either
P must be defined in terms of T or T defined in terms of P.
The V's and M and M&acute; may be independently defined, and
arbitrary numbers may be assigned for them limited only
by the necessity that MV + M&acute;V&acute; be a fixed sum.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> But P
and T cannot, with respect to each other, be thus independently
defined. The highly artificial character of T
has been pointed out by Professor E. B. Wilson, of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in his review of
Fisher's <i>Purchasing Power of Money</i> in the <i>Bulletin of the
American Mathematical Society</i>, April, 1914, pp. 377-381.
"Various consequences are readily obtained from the equation
of exchange, but the determination of the equation itself
is not so easy as it might look to a careless thinker.
The difficulties lie in the fact that P and T individually
are quite indeterminate. An average price-level P means
nothing till the rules for obtaining the average are specified,
and independent rules for evaluating P and T may not
satisfy [the equation.] For instance, suppose sugar is 5c.
a pound, bacon 20c. a pound, coffee 35c. a pound. The
average price is 20c. If a person buys 10 lbs. of sugar, 3
lbs. of bacon, and 1 lb. of coffee, the total trading is in 14 lbs.
of goods. The total expenditure is $1.45; the product of
the average price by the total trade is $2.80; the equation
is very far from satisfied." Wilson thinks it necessary, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
make the matter straight, to define T, arbitrarily as
(MV + M&acute;V&acute;)/P in which case, the equation is true, but so obviously
a truism that no one would see any point in stating
it. T no longer has any independent standing. Fisher
has, however, an escape from this status for T, but only by
reducing P to the same position. He defines P as the
<i>weighted</i> average of the p's (27), and fails, I think, to see
how completely this ties it up with T. The only method
of weighting the p's that will leave the equation straight
is to weight the different prices by the number of units of
each kind of good sold, namely, T. Thus, in Wilson's
illustration, we would define P as [(5c.&times;10) + (20c.&times;3) + (35c.&times;1)]/14  P is
then 10<small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>14</sub></small> c., while T is 14. PT is, then, equal to $1.45,
which is the total expenditure, or MV + M&acute;V&acute;. Be it
noted, here, that P is defined in terms of T, <i>i. e.</i>, P is defined
as a fraction, the denominator of which is T. No
other definition of P will serve, if T is to be defined independently.</p>

<p>But notice the corollary. P must be differently defined
each year, for each new equation, as T changes in total
magnitude, and as the elements in T are changed. The
equation cannot be kept straight otherwise. Suppose that
the prices remain unchanged in the next year, but that one
more pound of coffee, and two less pounds of sugar are sold.
P, as defined for the equation of the preceding year would
no longer fit the equation. P, as previously defined, would
be unaltered, since none of the prices in it had changed.
P, defined as a weighted average with the weights of the
first year, would, then, still be 10<small><sup>5</sup>/<sub>14</sub></small> cents. The T in the
new equation is 13. The product of P and T is $1.34<small><sup>9</sup>/<sub>14</sub></small>.
But the total expenditure, (MV + M&acute;V&acute;) is $1.70. The
equation is not fulfilled. To fulfill the equation, it is necessary
to get a new set of weights for P, in terms of the new
T of the new equation. From the standpoint of a <i>causal</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
theory, this is delightful. P is the <i>problem</i>. But you are
not allowed to <i>define</i> the problem until you know what the
<i>explanation</i> is! Then you define the problem as that which
the explanation will explain!</p>

<p>Fisher, however, appears unaware of this. At all events,
he does not mention it. And he ignores it in filling out his
equation statistically, for he assigns one set of weights to
the particular prices in his P throughout.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>The causal theory with which the equation of exchange
is associated is as follows: P is passive. A change in the
equation cannot be initiated by P. If P should change
without a prior change in one of the other factors, forces
would be set in operation which would force it back to its
original magnitude. M and T are independent magnitudes.
A change in one does not occasion a change in the
other. An increase or decrease in M will not cause a change
in V. Therefore, an increase in M must lead to a proportionate
increase in P, and a decrease in M to a proportionate
decrease in P, if the equation is to be kept straight.
Changes in T have opposite proportional effects on P.</p>

<p>Before examining the validity of the causal theory, and
the arguments by which it is supported, it will be best to
state the more complex formula which Professor Fisher
advances as expressing the facts of to-day. The original
formula ignored credit, and ignored the possibility of resort
to barter. It also failed to reckon with certain complications
which Fisher deals with as "transitional" rather than
"normal."</p>

<p>The formula which includes credit is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
MV + M&acute;V&acute; = PT<br />
</p></div>

<p>Here, MV and PT have the same significance as before.
M&acute; is the average amount of bank-deposits in the given<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
region for the given period, and V&acute; is the velocity of circulation
of those deposits. M, money, consists of all the media
of exchange in circulation which are <i>generally</i> acceptable,
as distinguished from those which are acceptable under
particular conditions, as by endorsement. M excludes
money in bank reserves and government vaults. Money,
specifically, includes gold and silver coin, minor coins,
government paper money, and bank-notes; M&acute; consists of
deposits transferable by check. This version would not
satisfy such a writer as Nicholson,<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> who would limit money
to gold coin, and would include in M&acute; not only deposits,
but also bank-notes, and other credit instruments. I may
suggest here, what I shall later emphasize, that Fisher's
"money," though he doubtless is using the most common
definition of money, is really a pretty heterogeneous group
of things, concerning which it is possible to make few general
statements safely. In economic essence, <i>e. g.</i>, bank-notes
are much more like deposits than like gold, and if one wishes
to separate money and credit, bank-notes belong with M&acute;
rather than with M. But we must take the theory as we
find it! Again, credit is by no means exhausted when bank-deposits
are named. Why should not book-credits, and
bills of exchange be included? Why not postal money-orders,
why not deposits subject to transfer by the giro-system?
M&acute; is defined<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> as "the total deposits subject to
transfer by check," and would, thus, exclude the giro-system
of Germany. It is surely a very provincial equation
of exchange, with which Fisher and Kemmerer seek to set
forth the universal laws of money! Fisher's reason for
excluding book-credits is that book-credits merely postpone,
and do not dispense with, the use of money and checks.<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
Book-credits, unlike deposits, have no <i>direct</i> effect on prices
(<i>Ibid.</i>, 82, n.; 370), but only an indirect effect, by increasing
the velocity of money. (<i>Ibid.</i>, 81-82; 370-371.) Book-credit,
indeed "time-credit" in general thus has no direct
effect on prices, and is properly excluded from the equation
of exchange. These distinctions seem to me highly artificial.
In the first place, the use of checks, in part, merely postpones
the use of money: money is moved back and forth
from one part of the country to another, and from one bank
to another, to the extent that checks fail to offset one
another, and in the case of book-credit, while there is less
of this offsetting, there is a good deal of it, especially
between stockbrokers in different cities, and in small towns
and at country stores, and particularly in the South, where
the country storekeeper and "factor" are also dealers
in cotton, etc., and where they advance provisions during
the year to the small farmers, receiving their pay, in considerable
degree, not in money, but in cotton, which they
credit on the books in terms of money to the customer&mdash;a
point which Fisher mentions in an appendix. (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 371.)
The difference on this point is a difference in degree merely.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Further, Fisher makes the same point with reference to
deposits subject to check that he makes with reference to
book-credits, namely, that their use increases the velocity
of money. To say that one has a <i>direct</i> effect on prices, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
the other only an indirect effect is absolutely arbitrary.
If buying and selling are what count, if prices are forced up
by the offer of money or credit for goods, and forced down
as the amount of money and credit offered for goods is
reduced, then one exchange must count for as much as any
other of like magnitude in fixing prices. The same is true
of transactions in which bills of exchange or other credit
devices serve as media of exchange. Of course these considerations
do not render the equation of exchange, as
presented by Fisher, untrue. The equation simply states
that the money and bank-deposits used in paying for goods
in a given period are equal to the amount paid for those
goods in a given period. It makes no assertion concerning
payments for other goods, and makes no assertion as to the
amount of other transactions which are paid for in other
ways. General Walker, presented with the problem of
credit phenomena, simplifies the thing even more.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> He
rules out all exchanges which are effected by credit devices,
counting only those performed by coin, bank-notes and
government paper money, and insists that the general price-level
is determined in those exchanges in which money
alone (as thus defined) is employed. His equation&mdash;if he
had considered it worth while to use one&mdash;would then have
been simply</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
MV = PT<br />
</p></div>

<p>where T would be merely the number of goods exchanged
by means of money. One could make a similar equation,
equally true, by defining money as gold coin, and reducing
T correspondingly. Is there any reason for limiting the
equation at all?<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Is there any reason for supposing that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
any one set of exchanges is more significant for the determination
of the price-level than any other set of exchanges?
Does not the logic of the quantity theory require us to include
all exchanges which run in terms of money?&mdash;If one
wishes a complete picture of the exchanges, some such
equation as this would be necessary:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
MV + M&acute;V&acute; + BV&acute;&acute; + EV&acute;&acute;&acute; + OV&acute;&acute;&acute;&acute; = PT,<br />
</p></div>

<p>where B represents book-credit, V&acute;&acute; the number of times a
given average amount of book-credit is used in the period,
E bills of exchange, and V&acute;&acute;&acute; their velocity of circulation,
and O all other substitutes for money, with V&acute;&acute;&acute;&acute; as their
velocity of circulation. Even then we have not a complete
picture, if direct barter or the equivalents of barter can be
shown to be important.</p>

<p>For the present, I waive a discussion of the comparative
importance of these different methods of conducting exchanges.
The situation varies greatly with different countries.
Fisher's and Kemmerer's equations are at best
plausible when presented as describing American conditions,
are much less plausible when applied to Canada and
England, and are caricatures when applied to Germany
and France.</p>

<p>So much for the statement of the equation of exchange,
except that it is important to add that the period of time
chosen for the equation is one year. Just why a year,
rather than a month or two years or a decade should be
chosen, may await full discussion till later. I shall venture
here the opinion that the yearly period is not the period that
should have been chosen from the standpoint of Fisher's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>causal theory, and that it probably was chosen, if for any
conscious reason at all, because of the fact that statistical
data which Fisher wished to put into it are commonly
presented as annual averages. The question now is, however,
as to the use to be made of the equation in the development
of a causal theory.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h3>THE VOLUME OF MONEY AND THE VOLUME OF
CREDIT</h3>


<p>John Stuart Mill, who first among the great figures
in economics gives a realistic analysis of modern credit
phenomena, thought that credit acts on prices in the same
way that money itself does<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and that this reduces the significance
of the quantity theory tendency greatly, and to an
indeterminate degree. The quantity theory is largely
whittled away in Mill's exposition of the influence of credit.
In Fisher we have a much more rigorous doctrine. The
quantity of money still governs the price-level, because M
governs M&acute;. The volume of bank-deposits depends on the
volume of money, and bears a pretty definitely fixed ratio
to it. Just how close the relation is, Professor Fisher does
not say, but the greater part of his argument, especially
in ch. 8,<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> rests on the assumption that the ratio is very
constant and definite indeed. At all events, the importance
of the theory, as an explanation of concrete price-levels,
will vary with the closeness of this connection, and the
invariability of this ratio. It is not too much to say <i>that
the book falls with this proposition</i>, to wit, that M controls
M&acute;, and that there is a fixed ratio between them. We would
expect, therefore, a very careful and full demonstration
of the proposition, a care and fullness commensurate with
its importance in the scheme. But the reader will search
in vain for any proof, and will find only two propositions
which purport to be proof. These are: (1) that bank reserves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
are kept in a more or less definite ratio to bank deposits; (2)
that individuals, firms and corporations preserve more or
less definite ratios between their cash transactions and
their check transactions, and between their cash on hand
and their deposit balances.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>If these be granted, what follows: the money in bank-<i>reserves</i>
is no part of M! M is the money in circulation,
being exchanged against goods, not the money lying in
bank-vaults!<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> The money in bank-vaults does not figure
in the equation of exchange. As to the second part of the
argument, if it be granted, it proves nothing. The money
in the hands of individual and corporate depositors is by
no means all of M. It is not necessarily the greatest part.
The money in circulation is largely used in small retail
trade, by those who have no bank-accounts. A good
many of the smallest merchants in a city like New York
have no bank-accounts, since banks require larger balances
there than they can maintain. Enormous quantities of
money are carried in this country by laborers, particularly
foreign laborers. "The Chief of the Department of Mines
of a Western State points out that when an Italian, Hungarian,
Slav or Pole is injured, a large sum of money, ranging
from fifty dollars to five hundred or one thousand, is
almost always to be found on his person. A prominent
Italian banker says that the average Italian workman
saves two hundred dollars a year, and that there are enough
Italian workmen in this country, without considering other
nationalities, to account for three hundred million dollars
of hoarded money."<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> I do not wish to attach too great
importance to these figures, taken from a popular article
in a popular periodical. It is proper to point out, too,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
that these figures relate to hoarded money, rather than to
M, the money in circulation. But in part these figures
represent, not money absolutely out of circulation, but
rather, money with a sluggish circulation. And they are
figures of the money in the hands of poor and ignorant
elements of the population. Outside that portion of the
population&mdash;larger in this country than in any other by
far<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>&mdash;which keeps checking accounts, are a large body of
people, the masses of the big cities, the bulk of rural laborers,
especially negroes, the majority of tenant farmers,
a large proportion of small farm owners, especially nominal
owners, and not a few small merchants in the largest cities,
who have no checking accounts at all. A very high percentage
of their buying and selling is by means of money.
Kinley's results<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> show that 70% of the wages in the
United States are paid in cash, and, of course, the laborers
who receive cash pay cash for what they buy. (Not
necessarily at the <i>time</i> they buy!) Money for payrolls
is one of the serious problems in times of financial panics.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
To fix the proportion between money in the hands of bank
depositors and non-depositors is not necessary for my purposes&mdash;<i>a
priori</i> I should anticipate that there is no fixed
proportion. But it is enough to point out that money in
the hands of depositors is not the whole of Fisher's M. Of
what relevance is it, then, to point out, even if it were true,
that an unascertainable portion of M tends to keep a definite
ratio to M&acute;, when the thing to be proved is that the <i>whole</i>
of M tends to keep a definite ratio to M&acute;? Fisher's argument
is a clear <i>non-sequitur</i>. If it proves anything, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
proves that a sum of money,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> not part of M, and another
sum of money, an unknown fraction of M, each independently,
for reasons peculiar to each sum, tends to keep
a constant ratio to M&acute;. This gives us <i>l'embarras des
richesses</i> from the standpoint of a theory of causation!
Two independent factors, bank-reserves and money in the
hands of depositors, each tending to hold bank-deposits
in a fixed ratio, and yet each moved by independent causes!
By what happy coincidence will these two tendencies work
together? Or what is the causal relation between them?
And if, for some yet to be discovered reason, Professor
Fisher should prove to be right, and there should be a
fixed ratio between M as a whole and bank-deposits, would
it not indeed be a miracle if all three "fixed ratios" kept
together? Bank-deposits, indissolubly wedded to three
independent variables<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> (independent, at least, so far as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
anything Professor Fisher has said would show, and independent
in large degree, certainly, so far as any reason the
present writer can discover), must find their treble life
extremely perplexing. May it not be that Professor
Fisher has pointed the way to the real fact, namely, that
bank-deposits are subjected to a multitude of influences,
no one of which is dominant, which prevent any fixed ratio
between bank-deposits and any other one thing? At a
later point, I shall maintain that this is, indeed, the case.</p>

<p>Be it noted further, however, that even if we grant a
fixed ratio, on the basis of Fisher's argument, between M
and M&acute;, Fisher has offered no jot of proof that the causation
runs from M to M&acute;. He simply assumes that point
outright. "Any change in M, the quantity of money in
circulation, <i>requiring as it normally does a proportional
change in M&acute;</i>, the volume of deposits subject to check."
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 52, Italics mine.) For this, no argument at all
is offered. A fixed ratio, so far as causation is concerned,
might mean any one of three things: (a) that M controls
M&acute;; (b) that M&acute; controls M; (c) that a common cause controls
both. Fisher does not at all consider these alternative
possibilities. I shall myself avoid a sweeping statement
as to the causal relations among the factors in the equation,
because I do not think that any of the factors is homogenous
enough, as an aggregate, to be either cause or effect of anything.
But if a generalization concerning these magni<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>tudes
were required, I should be disposed to assert that the
third alternative is the most defensible, and that to the
extent that M and M&acute; vary together it is under the influence
of a common cause, namely, PT! That is to say,
that the volume of bank-deposits and the volume of money
tend to increase or decrease in a given market&mdash;and Fisher's
theory is a theory of the market even of a single city<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>&mdash;<i>because
of</i> increases or decreases in PT (considered as a
unitary cause rather than as two separate factors) in that
market. But I shall not put my proposition in quite that
form, as I find the factors in the equation of exchange too
indefinite for satisfactory causal theory.</p>

<p>So much for the validity of Fisher's argument, assuming
the facts to be as he states them. Are the statements
correct? Do banks tend to keep fixed ratios between deposits
and reserves? Do individuals, firms, and corporations
tend to keep fixed ratios between their cash on
hand and their balances in bank? Regarding this last
tendency, Professor Fisher says in a footnote on p. 50,
"This fact is apparently overlooked by Laughlin." I
think it has been generally overlooked. I have found no
one who has discovered it except Professor Fisher. Certainly
no depositor whom I have consulted can find it in
his own practice&mdash;and I have put the question to "individuals,
firms, and corporations." The further statement
which Professor Fisher adduces in its support does not
prove it, namely, that cash is used for small payments, and
checks for large payments.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> It would be necessary to go
further and prove that large and small payments bear a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
constant ratio to one another, and further, that velocities
of money and of bank-deposits employed in these ways
bear a constant relation. If Fisher has any concrete data,
of a statistical nature, to support the doctrine of a constant
ratio between bank-balance and cash on hand in the case
of individual depositors, he has failed to put them into his
book. Nor is there any statistical evidence offered in the
case of banks. It should be noted here that finding a general
average for a whole country or community would not
prove Fisher's point. General averages give no concrete
causal relations. Fisher's argument, moreover, starts
with individual banks and individual deposit-accounts
(pp. 46 and 50) and generalizes the individual practice into
a community practice. He would have to offer data as to
individual cases.</p>

<p>While general averages could not <i>prove</i> the contention of
a constant ratio between reserves and deposits for individual
banks, general averages can <i>disprove</i> the contention. A
constant general average would be consistent with wide
variation in individual practices, on the principle of the
"inertia of large numbers." But if the general average is
<i>inconstant</i>, it is impossible that the individual factors making
it up should be constant. This disproof is readily at
hand, both for the ratio of deposits to reserves in the
United States, and for the ratio of demand obligations to
reserves among European banks (most of which do not
make large use of the check and deposit system).</p>

<p>For the United States, from 1890 to 1911, taking yearly
averages, we have a variation in the ratio of reserves to
deposits of over 73% of the minimum ratio. The ratio
was 26% in 1894, and 15% in 1906. "The juxtaposition
of these extreme variations shows how inaccurate is the
assumption that the deposit currency may be treated
as a substantially constant multiple of the quantity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
money in banks."<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> For New York City, the annual average
percentage of reserves of Clearing House banks to net deposits
varies from 24.89% in 1907 to 37.59% in 1894.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a>
The extreme variations<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> in weekly averages are (for the
sixteen years, 1885-1900) 20.6% in August, 1893 and
45.2% in February, 1894. These figures are extreme,
since the number of occurrences is small for them, but
there are numerous occurrences of deviations from the mean
as wide apart as 24% and 42%.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The yearly fluctuation
in all these ratios is very great.</p>

<p>The ratio of money held by the banks and money held by
the people also shows wide variation, and considerable
yearly fluctuation. There is a further complication, for
the United States, of varying proportions of the total
monetary stock held by the Federal Treasury. As between
the banks and the public, the banks held about a third in
1893 (average for the year), and nearly half in 1911.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
Whatever may be the relations between money in the hands
of the people, money in banks, and volume of deposits, in
"the static state," there is no statistical evidence whatever
to justify the notion of fixed relations among them in real
life.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> We shall later show that there can be no static laws
whatever governing the relations of credit and reserves.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>For European banks, the case is equally clear. European<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
bankers deny any intention of keeping any definite reserve
ratio. This appeared very clearly in the "Interviews"
obtained for the Monetary Commission with leading European
bankers.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> The Banque de France increased its gold
reserves, between 1899 and 1910, by 75%, but increased
its discounts and advances during the same period by
only 5%.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> J. M. Keynes<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> points out that the reserves
of the great banks of the world, and of Treasuries
which act as central banks, have absorbed an enormous
part of the gold produced in the fifteen years before the
War, increasing their holdings from about five hundred
million pounds sterling in 1900 to one billion pounds
sterling at the outbreak of the War. "The object of
these accumulations has been only dimly conceived by the
owners of them. They have been piled up partly as the
result of blind fashion, partly as the almost <i>automatic consequence</i>,
in an era of abundant gold supply, of the particular
currency arrangements which it has been orthodox to
introduce.... The ratios of gold to liabilities vary very
extremely from one country to another, without always
being explicable by reference to the varying circumstances
of those countries.... The contingencies, against which
a gold reserve is held, are necessarily so vague that the
problem of assessing the proper ratio must be, within
wide limits, indeterminate. It is natural, therefore, that
bankers, who must act one way or the other, should often
fall back on mere usage or accept <i>that amount of gold as
sufficient</i> which, <i>if they are chiefly passive, the tides of gold
bring them</i>. [Italics mine.] At any rate, the management
of gold reserves is not yet a science in most countries.
There is no ideal virtue in the present level of these re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>serves.
Countries have got on in the past with much less,
and under force of circumstances could do so again."</p>

<p>It will be noticed that Keynes, in the passage cited, is
speaking of <i>gold</i> reserves, while Fisher's contention relates
to all kinds of money available for reserves, which in this
country would include gold, silver dollars, greenbacks, and,
for many State banks, the notes of national banks. He is
also talking of the relation of reserves to demand <i>liabilities</i>,
which for most great European banks are primarily notes,
rather than of reserves to deposits. But as an exposition
of the theory of the ratio of reserves to deposits (the chief
liability of American banks), it is applicable to American
conditions, and as a statement of the facts, it of course
gives a basis for testing Fisher's doctrine generally. I do
not think that Fisher's fixed ratio, as between reserves and
deposits, or even the ratio which more moderate quantity
theorists might seek to find between gold and demand liabilities,
will find any justification in the facts of banking history.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>A factor which has developed on a grand scale in recent
years has tended still further to weaken any tendency that
may be supposed to exist toward a fixed ratio between
money-reserves and demand-liabilities. I refer to the
gold exchange-standard, in India, the Philippines, and
elsewhere, and to the practice of the great banks of the
continental countries of Europe, particularly the Bank of
Austria-Hungary, of holding foreign gold bills, rather than
gold exclusively, as reserve to cover note issue. In the
case of the Austro-Hungarian Bank, which has carried this
practice to the extreme, all possibility of a fixed ratio between
gold reserves and demand-liabilities has vanished.
The ratio is highly flexible. When bills are cheap, <i>i. e.</i>,
when the exchange is "in favor" of Austria-Hungary, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Bank buys bills with gold; when bills are high, when the
exchanges have turned "against" Austria-Hungary, the
Bank sells bills for gold. Commonly, the holder of a note
of the Austro-Hungarian Bank does not ask for it to be
redeemed in gold, but in foreign exchange. The reason
for this practice on the part of the Bank is primarily economy.
A large holding of gold would represent idle capital&mdash;a
heavy burden for the Bank of a debt-ridden and poorly
developed country. Foreign bills, however, serve equally
well for maintaining the value of the bank-notes, and at
the same time bear interest.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> A similar practice has been
employed by the Reichsbank, by the National Bank of
Belgium,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> by virtually all the debtor countries of Europe,
and the great trading countries of Asia.</p>

<p>Confidence in these conclusions is much increased by a
study of the views of Professor Taussig.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> Professor Taussig
is, in his initial formulations of his doctrine, a quantity
theorist. In a situation where only money is used, credit
being excluded, in effecting exchanges, he would hold that
the quantity theory correctly accounts for prices. He is
fond of the old formulation, as a first approximation, even
in dealing with the complex facts of modern banking. But
he does not dodge the complex facts, and his theory becomes,
substantially, first, a general formula, and second,
an elaborate body of qualifications and exceptions, the
latter making up the major part of the theory. His doctrine
regarding the relation of money and credit is as follows:
there is, in the long run, a real <i>limitation</i> on elastic
credit instruments in the quantity of <i>specie</i>. (This is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
different from the assertion that there is a <i>fixed</i> ratio between
<i>deposits</i> and <i>money</i> in circulation, including paper,
bank-notes, etc., in money. The present writer has no
quarrel with the doctrine that the gold supply of the <i>world</i>
imposes <i>outside</i> limitations on the <i>possible</i> expansion of
credit.) The limitation, Taussig holds, comes in two
ways: (1), in the connection between prices in any one country,
and prices in the world at large; (2), in various links of
connection between the volume of deposits (and of notes
elastic like deposits) and the quantity of specie. I shall
consider at a later point the relation between prices in
different countries.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> I shall there maintain that the
quantity theory, which explains gold movements on the
basis of price-<i>levels</i> in different countries, is inadequate;
that not price-levels, but particular prices, of goods most
available for international trade, are of primary importance,
and that of these particular prices, one, namely the
"price of money," or the short time money-rate, is most
significant of all. For the present, I wish to analyze the
linkages which Taussig finds between elastic credit instruments
and specie, and to see how far they would go, not
in proving Taussig's point (with which I have little quarrel)
but in proving Fisher's contentions. The points involved
are: (a) <i>Direct necessity</i> constrains the bankers to keep <i>some</i>
cash on hand.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> This fixes a <i>minimum limit</i> (Taussig's
contention), but does not at all suggest a "normal ratio"
(Fisher's contention). (b) <i>Binding custom</i>, as to the
proper amount of reserve that banks should carry, particularly
important in connection with the Bank of England,
but also in evidence in the Banque de France and the
Reichsbank. Here again, however, minimal, rather than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
fixed, ratios are suggested. Limitations on the <i>expansion</i>
of credit these customs may impose, but they by no means
determine a normal, or average amount of credit expansion&mdash;in
England least of all, since there is so large a flexible
element in the deposits of the Joint Stock Banks, whose
reserves are largely secret. The statement <i>supra</i> quoted
from Keynes, together with the testimony of European
bankers, may be considered in connection with this point,
also, as to the factors determining the reserve policies of
the great European banks. The extent to which custom
really binds is doubtful. (c) <i>Direct regulation by law</i>, peculiar
to the United States. Here again, a minimum,
rather than a fixed ratio, is indicated. Some <i>limitation</i> on
credit expansion by the banks is caused by this at times,
but Fisher's argument would require vastly more. (d)
<i>The interaction in the use of deposits, notes, and other constituents
in the circulating medium.</i> The point involved
here is that different kinds of business call for different
kind of media. Small retail business is not done with
hundred dollar bills, nor are stocks and bonds bought with
pennies. Limiting the size of bank-notes to five pounds in
England compels the use of a large amount of gold for
smaller transactions, and keeps a larger amount of gold in
use than would otherwise be the case. Expanding business
draws cash from the banks for circulation, trenching on reserves.
That Professor Taussig has a point here is not to
be doubted, but how closely it limits the expansion of
credit will depend on the degree to which different kinds of
media of exchange really <i>are</i> thus specialized. In a country
like the United States, where checks may be used for virtually
any transaction of over a dollar, and where small
change for less than a dollar will be increased by the Government
to meet the demands of trade, the point would
not seem to involve a practically serious limitation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>Finally, Professor Taussig recognizes a coefficient with
the quantity of specie in the <i>temper of the business community</i>.
Whether or not deposits are to expand, depends
not only on reserves, but also on the attitude of borrowers.</p>

<p>Taussig concludes: "Thus there is only a rough and uncertain
correspondence of bank expansion with bank reserves;
much play for ups and downs which have no close
relation to the amount of cash in bank vaults, <i>and still less
direct relation to the amount of money afloat in the community
at large</i>. Where bank media, whether in the form of deposits
or notes, are an important part of total purchasing
power, the connection between general prices and quantity
of 'money' is irregular and uncertain." (Italics mine.)</p>

<p>This conclusion would be of little service in supporting
Fisher's rigorous contentions! Our constructive theory concerning
the relations of reserves and deposits, or reserves and
demand liabilities, must wait for later discussion, in the
chapter on "Bank Assets and Bank Reserves" in Part III.
It will there be maintained that there are no "normal" or
"static" laws governing the percentage of reserves to demand
liabilities, or to deposits, that the reserve function of
money is a <i>dynamic</i> function, and that its whole explanation
must be found in dynamic considerations. For the present,
I am content to have analyzed two widely divergent views,
one the extreme view of Professor Fisher, representing the
quantity theory in its utmost rigor, and the other, the
view of Professor Taussig, who virtually surrenders the
quantity theory in complex modern conditions.</p>

<p>In between these two writers, verging more toward
Fisher than toward Taussig, will be found, with great individual
variation, the rest of the quantity theorists. The
quantity theory, as an instrument of prediction, becomes
important only to the extent that Fisher's view is maintained.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h3>"NORMAL" VS. "TRANSITIONAL" TENDENCIES</h3>


<p>The Quantity Theory, as a causal theory, is, then, little
altered by the passage from a hypothetical, creditless economy
to the actual world, where a vast deal of credit is
used,&mdash;particularly in Professor Fisher's hands. Of the
different kinds of credit, only deposits subject to check are
recognized as directly influencing prices, and deposits subject
to check are controlled by the volume of money. The
causal theory<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> remains, then, as follows: if M be increased,
it will increase M&acute; proportionately; it will not change the
V's; it cannot increase T; to keep the equation straight,
therefore, P must rise in proportion to the rise in M. A
decrease of M, reducing M&acute; proportionately, leaving V's
and T unchanged, must proportionately reduce P. P is
passive. A change in P cannot sustain itself, unless it be
due to a prior change in T, the V's, M or M&acute;.</p>

<p>This theory is set forth with the qualification that these
effects are the "normal" effects of the changes in question.
The proportion between quantity of money and price-level
is not strictly maintained during "transition periods." I
now approach the most difficult question which I shall have
to answer as to the meaning of Fisher's terms. The same
problem arises for all quantity theorists. Precisely what
is the distinction between "transition periods" and "normal
periods"? What limitations and qualifications does
he admit to the rigorous statement of his theory so far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
given? I may first express the opinion that the line shifts
greatly in his own mind, or at least shifts greatly in the exposition.
I do not find an explicit statement in which definitions
are given. The matter is chiefly discussed by
Fisher in ch. 4,<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> which is called "Disturbance of Equation
and of Purchasing Power during Transition Periods."
There we find, as I have stated, no definitions, but the initial
statements would suggest the following: a transition period
is the period following a change in any one of the factors
in the equation during which a readjustment among all the
others is taking place; the normal period is the period preceding
such a change, or following the transition after such
a change, and is characterized by the fact that all the factors
are at rest, in stable equilibrium. Equilibria during
transition periods are unstable. During the transition,
the relations among the factors vary: M and M&acute; need not
keep their fixed ratio; P need not be wholly passive; M and
P need not keep the same proportion. But until M and
M&acute; get back into the normal ratio, until P becomes proportional
to M (in the proportion prior to the initial disturbance),
there is no rest; the equilibrium is unstable. How
long is a transition period? How realistic is the notion of a
transition period? Is the transition period a theoretical
device, to aid in isolating causes, or is it supposed to be a
real period in time? Is the normal period a real period in
time, or is it merely a theoretical hypothesis? It is not
easy to answer these questions. Thus (p. 72) the seasonal
fluctuations are declared to be "normal and expected,"
and, at the same time, one gets the impression that Fisher
considers them illustrations of his "transitions," in which
the normal theory does not strictly hold (pp. 72, 169).
What is described chiefly in the chapter on transition
periods is the business cycle&mdash;a theory of the business<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
cycle, based primarily on the notion that the failure of
interest to rise as fast as prices rise causes the "boom,"
and that the draining of bank reserves precipitates the
crisis. I shall not discuss this theory, as a theory of business
cycles, further than to say that Wesley Mitchell's
study would indicate that the interest rate is a minor
factor, and that, while as a theoretical possibility, the
drains on bank reserves may check prosperity if something
else doesn't do it first, practically something else always
does come in ahead, so far as his studies have gone.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> My
interest here is primarily in seeing the limitations Fisher imposes
on his theory, and the qualifications he admits. If
the business cycle is the typical transition period, during
which his normal theory doesn't hold, when does the
normal theory hold? When are the "normal periods"?
There is no concrete period during which prices are neither
rising nor falling, during which no important changes are
taking place among the factors.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> At times, Fisher seems
to indicate that the normal period is imaginary (pp. 56,
159). Is, then, the contrast between a realistic "transition
period" and a hypothetical "normal period" or are both
hypothetical? Is the equation of exchange, too, a mere
hypothesis? It should be, if it is to set forth a merely hypothetical
theory. But no, Fisher insists on putting concrete
data into it, and, indeed, gives an elaborate statistical
"proof" of the equation. It, at least, is realistic. I confess
that my certainty as to Fisher's meaning grows less,
as I study his book with greater care. If the typical transition
period be the business cycle, then the normal period
could come only once, say, in ten years&mdash;or whatever
period, regular, or irregular, one chooses to assign to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
business cycle. The concrete price-levels for the greater
part of the time are then surrendered to other causes. And
the one-year cycle described in the equation of exchange
is quite irrelevant. The equation of exchange should
cover the whole business cycle, to fit in with the theory.
Indeed, a realistic equation of exchange would then have
no meaning at all, as the average price-level during the
business cycle, played upon by a host of causes other than
the factors described in the quantity theory, would not be
the same as the average price-level which <i>would have</i>
obtained had only the "normal" causes been in operation.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>The distinction between "normal" and "transition"
<i>periods</i> suggests a dangerous fallacy: namely, that during
one period one sort of causation is working, with the other
in abeyance. In fact, whatever causes there are are working
all the time. The only legitimate thing is to abstract
from one set of causes, and see what the other set, if left to
themselves, will bring about. But this sort of abstraction
has many dangers, one of which is that the causes abstracted
from are frequently thought of as non-existent.
The chemist, in his laboratory, can in actual physical fact
abstract impurities from his chemicals, and see what they
will do. He can even perform experiments in what is
practically a vacuum. But the economist has no right to
<i>think in vacuo</i>! All that he has a right to do is to assume
the factors which he does not wish to study <i>constant</i>. And
even that he must not do if (1) changes in the factors which
he wishes to study do in fact lead to changes in the factors
abstracted from, or (2) if the factors which he wishes to
study can only change <i>because</i> of prior or concomitant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
changes in the factors from which he is abstracting.
Is it, for example, legitimate to assume an increase
in M&acute; apart from its usual accompaniment, an increase
in PT?</p>

<p>The notion, too, that causation can be seen in a state of
stable equilibrium should be critically analyzed. Causation
is only <i>revealed</i> by a <i>course of events</i>, when mechanical
causation is involved. The relation of cause and effect
may be a contemporaneous relation in fact, and it is possible,
where conscious, psychological phenomena are involved,
to discern causal relations among the elements in a
mental state by direct introspection. It is the not uncommon
practice, also, in the theory of mechanics, or in theoretical
economics, where the method of investigation is
deductive rather than inductive, to abstract from the temporal
sequence, and to construe causal relations as timeless,
logical relations. But even here, the cause of a <i>change</i> in
the general situation precedes the change in time, and it is
only by abstraction that the time element is left out. If
there is no question as to the causal relations, this abstraction
is legitimate, but if all that one knows about the situation
be that in a stable equilibrium certain constant ratios
obtain, then the question as to which term in the ratio is
cause and which is effect remains unanswered. In Fisher's
situation, then, assuming that it be true&mdash;which I shall
deny&mdash;that the only stable equilibrium is that which the
normal theory requires, it still remains true that the causal
relations among the factors can only be revealed by a study
of the transitions, by seeing the temporal sequence of
changes in the factors of the equation. Even if it be
granted that M, M&acute; and P tend to keep a constant relation
to one another, the quantity theory falls if, for instance,
it can be shown that a change may first occur in P, spread
to M&acute;, and finally reach M last of all, leading to a new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
normal equilibrium which is stable. I shall later show
cases of this sort.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>The abstract formulation of Fisher's contrast will not, I
believe, give us an answer as to the extent to which he
thinks his quantity theory realistic. I find myself particularly
in genuine uncertainty as to the point mentioned
above: would an actual equation of exchange for the whole
business cycle, made up of the averages of M, M&acute;, V, V&acute;, P
and T for the whole period, exhibit the "normal" relations
among these factors? Or would this "normal" relation
only emerge concretely at some moment of time in the
course of the cycle when the abnormal causes affecting the
price-level happened to offset one another? Or is it true
that no actual figures which might be found, either for a
moment of time, or as averages for any given period, will
exhibit the relations required, and that only a hypothetical
equation, based on the figures for M, M&acute;, V, V&acute;, P and T
that <i>would have been realized</i> had there been no "disturbing"
causes, will show these "normal" relations? If, as Fisher
at times indicates&mdash;as in his reference to Boyle's Law
(p. 296)&mdash;he is stating only an abstract tendency, which
may be neutralized by other tendencies in the situation, so
far as concrete results are concerned, then it is this last
doctrine which we must take, and the concrete equation of
exchange has little if any relevance. If, moreover, this
last interpretation be given, then the whole of Fisher's
elaborate statistical "proof" is pointless. The only sort
of statistical proof which would be relevant would be of a
much subtler sort, not a mere filling out of the equation
of exchange by means of annual figures, but an effort to
disentangle and measure the <i>importance</i> of his tendency, as
compared with other tendencies. But we have the other
tendencies merely mentioned in qualitative terms, and we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
never find any definite statement, of mathematical character,
as to how important they are.</p>

<p>It seems pretty clear, however, that on the whole, despite
occasional suggestions that his theory is abstract, Fisher
means his theory to be the overwhelmingly important point
in the explanation of actual price-levels. He is particularly
insistent on the high degree of the generality of his contention
that P is passive. Thus: "So far as I can discover,
<i>except to a</i> <small>LIMITED</small> <i>extent during transition periods,
or during a passing season</i>, (<i>e. g.</i>, <i>the fall</i>) (capitals mine,
italics Fisher's), there is no truth whatever in the idea that
the price-level is an independent cause of changes in any
of the other magnitudes, M, M&acute;, V, V&acute;, or the Q's."<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> On
p. 182 he enumerates in a series of propositions his general
normal theory, and adds, as the first sentence of proposition
9: "Some of the foregoing propositions <i>are subject to</i>
<small>SLIGHT</small> <i>modification during transition periods</i>." (Italics and
capitals mine.) And the general drift of the argument,
particularly in chapter 8, where the heart of Fisher's
causal theory is presented, would indicate that the concessions
he is disposed to make are very slight, indeed.</p>

<p>The question as to how long a <i>time</i> is required, in Fisher's
view, for a transition to occur, and for his normal tendencies
to dominate, is nowhere made clear. The quantity theory,
in the hands of some writers, is a very long run theory, for
others, it is a short run theory. Thus, Taussig would
make the "run" exceedingly long.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Mill makes it a short
run theory. "It is not, however, with ultimate or average,
but with immediate and temporary prices, that we are now
concerned. These, as we have seen, may deviate widely
from the standard of cost of production. Among other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
causes of fluctuation, one we have found to be, the quantity
of money in circulation. Other things being the same, an
increase of the money in circulation raises prices, a diminution
lowers them. If more money is thrown into circulation
than the quantity which can circulate at a value conformable
to its cost of production, the value of money, so
long as the excess lasts, will remain below the standard
of cost of production, and general prices will be sustained
above the natural rate."<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> I pause to note that it is really
strange that a single name should describe theories so different,
resting on such essentially different logic. Long run
or short run theories, all are "quantity theories," whether
"money" be defined as gold, or as all manner of media of
exchange, or as only those media of exchange which pass
from hand to hand without endorsement. Fisher would
doubtless call his theory a long run theory. From the
standpoint of the notion that "prices ... lag behind their
full adjustment and have to be pushed up, so to speak, by
increased purchases,"<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> however, we get a short run quantity
theory doctrine. The logic of these two is very different.
The short run doctrine seeks to explain the actual
process of price-making in the market. Money is offered
against goods, and the actual quantities on each side determine
the momentary price-level, concretely. Or, when
credit is considered, money and credit offered against
goods, at a given time, or in a given short period, determine
the actual price-level reached. This is the logic of the
equation of exchange&mdash;actual money paid is necessarily
equal to actual money received. The long run doctrine
is fundamentally based on a different notion. Surrendering
the actual or average of price-levels to other causes, in
part, it still asserts that, given time enough, and barring
new disturbing tendencies, a price-level will ultimately be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
reached which will bear it out. I find no recognition, on
Fisher's part, of the fact that these two doctrines are different,
and, in fact, I find them blended and confused in the
course of his argument. He would doubtless maintain
that his is a long run doctrine. But how long is the "run"?
Sometimes it seems to be, as already shown, a whole business
cycle. Sometimes a passing season, as the fall. When
he undertakes to apply his theory to a practical proposal
for regulating the value of money, he relies on the quantity
theory tendency to bring about adjustments so quickly that
it is worth while to make <i>monthly</i> adjustments in anticipation
of it.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> When discussing the changes in gold premium
on the Greenbacks during the exciting times of the Civil
War, he relies so thoroughly on his theory that he will not
allow even the rapid change of four per cent in a single
day following Chickamauga to occur except in conformity
with the quantity theory. This last statement is so remarkable
that I must quote Fisher himself: "It would
be a grave mistake to reason, because the losses at Chickamauga
caused greenbacks to fall 4% in a single day, that
their value had no relation to their volume. This fall
indicated a slight acceleration in the velocity of circulation,
and a slight retardation in the volume of trade" (263). It
would be indeed remarkable if the changes in the gold
market, which got war news before the newspapers got it,
and where changes in gold premium occurred before the
rest of the country could possibly react to the war news,
should be controlled by V and T! I had not supposed that
the most rigorous of short run quantity theorists would
make any such demands on his theory as that. Indeed, I
had not supposed that the quantity theory would feel
called on to explain the gold premium, as such, except in
so far as the gold premium is an index of general prices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Finding it impossible to limit Fisher to any single statement
of the quantitative importance of his normal theory
as compared with the other tendencies at work, but concluding
that, on the whole, he considers it of high importance,
I shall now proceed to an analysis of the reasoning
by which he seeks to justify it as a <i>qualitative</i> tendency. I
shall maintain that, however long or short the period required,
however strong or weak the tendency he defends,
the reasoning by which he seeks to justify it is unsound,
and that even as a qualitative tendency, the quantity
theory is invalid. At a later part of the book, as in an
earlier part,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> I shall undertake to find the modicum of truth
which the quantity theory contains, and shall show that
no quantity theory is needed to exhibit this modicum of
truth.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h3>BARTER</h3>


<p>In the statement of the quantity theory, the proviso is
commonly made that all exchanges must be made by means
of money, or of money and bank-credit. Barter is excluded
by hypothesis. If resort to barter were possible,
then people might avert the fall in prices due to scarcity of
money, or increase in trade, by dispensing with money in
part of their transactions, and the proportional decrease
in prices which the quantity theory calls for would be lacking.
Is this assumption true? Is barter banished from
the modern world, or does it remain reasonably possible,
and, to a considerable degree, actual?</p>

<p>Fisher maintains the thesis&mdash;the failure of which he
admits would spoil the quantity theory<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>&mdash;that barter is
practically impossible, and negligible in modern business
life. "Practically, however, in the world to-day, even
such temporary resort to barter is trifling. The convenience
of exchange by money is so much greater than the
convenience of barter, that the price adjustment would be
made almost at once. If barter needs to be seriously
considered as a relief from money stringency, we shall be
doing it full justice if we picture it as a safety valve, working
against a resistance so great as almost never to come
into operation, and then only for brief transition intervals.
For all practical purposes and all normal cases, we may
assume that money and checks are necessities for modern
trade."<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>This contention seems to me untenable. I think it can
easily be shown that barter remains an important factor
in modern business life, especially if one extends the term
barter, a little, to cover various flexible substitutes for the
use of money and checks in effecting exchanges. Clearly
from the standpoint of the present issue, such an extension
of the meaning of barter is legitimate, as any such substitutes
would equally spoil the proportionality in the supposed
relation between prices and money, or prices and
trade.</p>

<p>Where does one find barter? Well, not to be ignored
would be the advertisements which fill many columns of
such a paper as the New York <i>Telegram</i> in the course of a
week; "Wanted: to trade a well-trained parrot for a violin"&mdash;a
trade that might, or might not, be a wise one! There
is a good deal of such simple barter among the people.
Then, perhaps more important, is the regular practice of
sewing machine, piano, automobile, and other similar companies
of taking part of the payment for a new machine,
piano,<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> or automobile in the similar thing which the owner
is discarding. The old machine, piano, etc., are then repaired,
repainted, and sold again. This is a very extensive
practice. Again, there are companies which combine
the business of wrecking old houses and building new
ones, who regularly take the old materials as part of their
pay. This is a highly important feature of the organized
building trade in great cities, and is frequently done in
small towns. The building trade is no negligible matter.
The "horse-trade" still thrives in rural regions, and barter
of various kinds, of live stock, of grain and hay, of fresh
and cured meat, and of labor, is an important feature in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
rural life in many sections. Much of agricultural rent in
the South is still paid in kind, under the "share system."
Much labor, especially farm and domestic labor, is still
paid for partly in kind. Where payments for labor are
made in orders on company stores, we have again what is
virtually barter, from the standpoint of the point at issue.
<i>Real estate</i> transactions make large use of barter. Farms
are exchanged for one another, with some cash (or more
usually, a promissory note) "to boot." The writer has
repeatedly heard real estate men say to customers: "I
can't sell it for you very easily, but I can trade it off, and
maybe you can sell what you trade it for." This is perhaps
more frequent in rural real estate transactions, and in
the smaller cities, than in large cities, but it is very extensive
in New York City.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>Again, when corporations are to be combined, various
plans are possible. There may be a merger; there may be
a holding corporation; there may be a lease. If the money
market is easy, one of the former methods will be used,&mdash;most
frequently, for legal reasons, the holding corporation,
if there are any valuable franchises involved. But mergers
and holding corporations commonly involve buying out
the interests which are to be absorbed, and call for the use
of checks. If the money market is tight, therefore, the
promoter of the combination may frequently find the lease
the more advantageous form of consolidation.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> The great
advantage of the lease is that, when the money market is
tight, it involves no <i>financial plan</i>, no underwriting, no
outlay of "cash." This is, therefore, an equivalent of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
barter, so far as the point at issue is concerned. Even
where a holding corporation is formed, however, there may
be considerable barter: the stockholders of the corporation
which is absorbed may receive payment for their stocks, in
whole or in part, in the securities of the holding company,
rather than in checks. An era of financial consolidation,
such as we have been passing through, and through which
we have not by any means gone, though the movement
toward <i>monopoly</i> has been in great degree checked, presents
a great deal of this sort of barter, or equivalents of barter.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
A striking thing to notice here, moreover, is the flexible
margin between use of bank-credit and barter, a margin
depending primarily upon the condition of the money
market, and particularly upon the money-rates.</p>

<p>Not yet has the most important element in modern
barter been mentioned. I refer to the "clearing-house"
arrangements of the stock and produce exchanges. Under
these arrangements, brokers who have sold ten thousand
shares of Westinghouse El. and M. Common during the
day, and bought seven thousand shares, buying and selling
being in smaller lots, with a number of different houses, no
longer are obliged to deliver ten thousand shares, receiving
therefor $700,000, and to receive seven thousand shares,
paying therefor $490,000. Instead, they deliver three
thousand shares only to the clearing house, and receive
from the clearing house only $210,000 when the transaction
is, from the standpoint of the particular broker involved,
completed. This is a far remove, in technical
perfection, from primitive barter, but it is barter, and it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
saves the using of a vast deal of bank-credit as between
brokers. How important it is, from the standpoint of the
stock exchange, may be judged from the following statement
in Sprague's <i>Crises Under the National Banking System</i>:
"A much more fundamental change in the organization in
the New York money market came with the establishment
of the stock exchange clearing house in May, 1892. It led
to a very considerable reduction in the <i>clearing-house exchanges
of the banks</i> and also, and more important, in the
volume of certified checks. [Italics mine.] Overcertification
of checks ceased to be a factor of the first magnitude
in the banking methods of the city. Had not this arrangement
for stock-exchange dealings been set up, it is probable
that it would have been necessary to close the stock exchange
in 1893 and in 1907, and it is also probable that
the volume of business transacted in the years after 1897
could not have been handled." (P. 152.)</p>

<p>The same arrangements have been widely introduced
in other stock exchanges, and in the produce exchanges.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>In general, with reference to barter, this point is significant.
The money economy has made barter <i>easier</i> rather
than harder. It has made possible a host of refinements
in barter, which make it at many points more convenient
and cheaper than check or money exchanges. It is common
to find our present methods of conducting foreign
trade described as a "system of refined barter," which indeed,
from the standpoint of the present issue, it is: bills of
exchange are neither money nor bank-credit! Where bills
of exchange are used in internal trade extensively&mdash;as in
Germany, where they pass from hand to hand in several
transactions before being discounted at banks<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a>&mdash;we have
a highly important substitute for money and deposits,
which functions as barter,&mdash;flexibility of substitutes for
money and deposits is strikingly evident. The feature of
the money economy which has thus refined and improved
barter is the <i>standard of value</i> (<i>common measure of value</i>)
function of money.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> This standard of value function, be
it noted, makes no call on money itself, necessarily. The
<i>medium of exchange</i> and "<i>bearer of options</i>" functions of
money are the chief sources of such additions to the value
of money as come from the money-use. But the fact that
goods have money-prices, which can be compared with
one another easily, in objective terms, makes barter, and
barter-equivalents, a highly convenient and very important
feature of the most developed commercial system.
And so we reject another essential assumption of the
quantity theory.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h3>VELOCITY OF CIRCULATION</h3>


<p>For the quantity theory, it is important to treat velocity
of circulation of money and of deposits, as self-contained
entities, really independent factors. This is true of Fisher's
theory. It is particularly necessary that V and V&acute; should
vary from causes unconnected with M and M&acute;. The V's
are to be a sort of inflexible channel, through which M and
M&acute; run in their influence on the passive P, which is to rise
or fall proportionately with them. If an increase of M or
M&acute; should lead to a reduction in the V's, if people, having
more money available, should be less assiduous in using
every bit of it in effecting exchanges, then P would not rise
in proportion to the increase in M. Complete demonstration
of Fisher's thesis, therefore, requires the proof of the
negative proposition that V does not change as a consequence
of changes in M or M&acute;. This proof Fisher finds in
the contention that the V's are fixed by the habits and conveniences
of individuals, whence they are not influenced by
such a cause as a change in the amount of money.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>V is defined,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> not as the number of times a given dollar is
exchanged in a given year (the "coin-transfer" notion),
but as a social average based on the average number of
coins which pass through <i>each man's</i> hands, divided by the
average amount held by him (the "person-turnover" concept
of velocity.) V&acute; is similarly defined. Fisher asserts
that both concepts, if correctly employed, lead to the same
result. I would point out one important difference between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
them here: if money is <i>short-circuited</i>, if, <i>i. e.</i>, a part of the
economic community loses its incomes, or finds its incomes
reduced, then the "velocity of money," on the "coin-transfer"
basis is reduced, provided the "person-turnover"
average remains the same, while on the "person-turnover"
basis the velocity will remain unchanged. It is clearly the
"coin-transfer" concept which is fundamental, from the
standpoint of the equation of exchange, and Fisher feels justified
in using the other method only because he considers it
an equivalent of the "coin-transfer" concept. I shall later
show cases where the distinction between the two concepts
is all-important, particularly in the case where T is
reduced by the elimination of <i>middlemen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p>The conception of velocity of circulation as a real, unitary
entity, a <i>cause</i>, in the process of price-determination, is,
I suppose, almost as old as the quantity theory itself. It
is an essential part of the quantity theory. To me "velocity
of circulation" seems to be a mere name, denoting, not
any simple cause or small set of causes, which can exert
a specific influence, but rather a meaningless abstract number,
which is the non-essential by-product of a highly
heterogeneous lot of <i>activities of men</i>, some of which work
one way, and others of which work in another way, in
affecting prices. It is at best a passive <i>resultant</i> of conflicting
and divergent tendencies, and has, to my mind, no
more <i>causal</i> significance than the average of the abstract
numbers of yards gained by both sides, heights and weights
of players, kick-offs, and minutes taken out for injuries,
would have on the result of the Yale-Harvard game. The
real causes of changes in prices lie deeper! I should expect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
V and V&acute; to be the most highly flexible factors in the equation
of exchange, and should expect to be able to keep the
equation straight, in a great variety of situations, by allowing
the V's to vary.</p>

<p>Before undertaking detailed analysis of the causes governing
V, I shall discuss Fisher's specific argument, typical
of the quantity theory, that an increase of money cannot
change the V's. "As a matter of fact, the velocities of
circulation of money and deposits depend, as we have seen,
on technical conditions, and bear no discoverable relation
to the quantity of money in circulation. Velocity of circulation
is the average rate of 'turnover,' and depends on
countless individual rates of turnover. These, as we have
seen, depend on individual <i>habits</i>. Each person regulates
his turnover to suit his individual <i>convenience</i>.... In
the long run, and for a large number of people, the average
rate of turnover, or what amounts to the same
thing, the average time money remains in the same hands,
will be closely determined. It will depend on density of
population, commercial <i>customs</i>, rapidity of transport, and
other technical conditions, but not on the quantity of
money and deposits nor on the price-level." (Italics
mine.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>) He proceeds to assume that money is doubled
with a <i>halving</i> of the V's, instead of a <i>doubling</i> of P. Everybody
now has on hand twice as much money <i>and deposits</i>
as his convenience has taught him to keep on hand. He
will then try to get rid of this surplus, and he can only do
it by buying goods. But this will increase somebody
else's surplus, and he will likewise try to get rid of it. This
will raise prices. "<i>Obviously</i> this tendency will continue
until there if found another adjustment of quantities to expenditures,
and the <i>V's are the same as originally</i>."<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> The
foregoing argument rests in part, it will be seen, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
assumption that a fixed ratio between M and M&acute; obtains,
else the increase of <i>money</i> in everybody's hands would not
mean a corresponding increase in their <i>deposits</i>. I have
already criticised this doctrine. For the contention that
the V's will finally be <i>just the same</i> as before, I find no specific
argument at all&mdash;"<i>obviously</i>" presumably making that
unnecessary.</p>

<p>As the point immediately at issue is that V's will be
<i>unchanged</i> by the increase in M (otherwise P would not
increase <i>proportionately</i>&mdash;let us see if considerations can
be adduced which will make this a little less "obvious."
First, it will be noticed that Fisher, in the foregoing, in one
sentence speaks of the matter as resting on <i>habit</i>, and in the
next sentence, on <i>convenience</i>. He speaks, also, of business
<i>custom</i>. Now it is important to note that habit and custom,
on the one hand, and considerations of convenience
on the other, do not necessarily coincide. Many habits
and customs are highly inconvenient. And it is not at all
likely that habit and custom should govern so highly complex
a thing as the ratio between cash on hand and the
price-level. Rather, in so far as custom and habit rule,
one would expect them to relate to a simpler matter,
namely, the <i>amount of cash on hand</i>. If the amount of
cash kept on hand should remain controlled by habit,
while the amount of money is increased, then V, instead of
remaining unchanged, would actually be increased, unless
the habits should be broken in on. I shall show in a moment
that considerations of convenience would probably
lead to a reduced V, in so far as individual turnover is concerned.
But which tendency will prevail? Well, that
will depend on the degree to which custom and habit rule
as compared with considerations of convenience&mdash;<i>i. e</i>.,
there would be no rule valid for all communities. That
convenience would lead to a larger amount of money on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
hand&mdash;and I am following Fisher's temporary hypothesis
that there has been no rise in prices prior to the movement
to restore the V's to their old magnitudes&mdash;will appear
from considerations like these. Few men have as much
on hand as they would like to have, including both their
cash in hand and their deposit balances. Most people
have the tendency to hoard, though it is usually held in
check by necessity. If money on hand be increased suddenly,
without prices being increased, and without any
prospect of increased incomes in the future&mdash;and there is
nothing in Fisher's provisional hypothesis to call for increased
incomes, as they could, in fact, come only from an
increase in prices&mdash;why might not there be a considerable
saving of money, with a corresponding reduction in V? If
it be objected that people, in saving their money, will in
considerable degree put it into the banks, and that the
banks, with larger reserves, will increase loans and deposits,
I would urge, that it is on the part of banks that this tendency
to increase hoards in times of abundant money is
particularly marked, and for proof would point to the
figures quoted from Keynes<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> for the great banks and
treasuries of Europe in the last fifteen years. It is not
necessary for my purpose at this point to do more than
show that there is reason to expect an increase in money to
<i>change</i> the V's. Fisher's argument rests on the contention
that the V's will be neither increased or reduced&mdash;otherwise
an increase in money will not <i>proportionately</i> raise
prices. The appeal to habit and custom in the matter is
particularly unsatisfactory. Custom and habit could not
possibly regulate things so complex as velocities of money
and bank-deposits.</p>

<p>Whatever be the ultimate effect of an increase in money,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
the immediate effect is commonly to reduce the money-rates.
Banks have less inducement to pay interest on
deposits, and charge lower rates for loans. Now merchants,
especially small merchants, are often embarrassed
in making change for customers. The man who has tried
to make payment with a ten dollar bill in a country store
has not infrequently put the storekeeper to much inconvenience.
To offer a ten dollar bill, or even a five dollar
bill, to a storekeeper on Amsterdam Avenue in New York
City may well mean that the one clerk in the establishment,
or the proprietor's wife will run out with the bill to three or
four neighboring stores before finding change with which to
break it. If money is more abundant, if money-rates are
easier, for a time, it may easily happen that many small
merchants will experience the superior convenience of having
a more adequate amount of change in the till, and
will, even after the money-rates have risen&mdash;if they do
rise again to the old figure&mdash;find a new reason for keeping
more cash on hand. There is a marginal equilibrium
between the interest on the capital invested in cash in the
till, and the wages of the clerk,<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> whose active legs assist
the velocity of money. Not only banks and small dealers,
however, find it advantageous to increase their supply of
ready funds, held idle for special occasions. The United
States Steel Corporation has kept as much as $50,000,000.00
to $75,000,000.00 in idle cash or idle deposits, as a means of
being independent of banks in times of emergency.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> The
motive for accumulating reserves and hoards, either of
cash or deposit accounts, is at all times strong. In times
of financial ease, it may easily find the difficulties which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
ordinarily repress it give way, and, by being gratified,
grow stronger.</p>

<p>I conclude that there is positive reason for expecting an
increase of money to reduce the velocity of money.</p>

<p>Horace White, in his <i>Money and Banking</i>, in the earlier
editions, speaks of the velocity of money, "<i>alias</i> the state
of trade." Is not this the truth? Is not money circulating
rapidly, when business is active, and slowly when business
is dull? Is not the velocity of circulation a highly
flexible and variable average, a <i>cause</i> of nothing, and an index
of business activity? Or, better, perhaps, are not the
V's and T both governed, in large degree, by more fundamental
causes which are largely the same for both? Fisher
would admit something of this for transition periods.
Even for normal adjustments, he admits that an increase
in T, unaccompanied by an increase in M, leads to some
increase in the V's, though he doesn't say how much.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
He denies, however, that an increase in the V's will increase
T.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> In general, it is clear that he regards the V's and T as
governed by different causes. The control of the V's by T
is not the only or the chief control of the V's. The V's
can increase greatly without an increase of T, in his scheme.
That this is so, will appear from a comparison of the list of
causes which he gives as governing the V's and T respectively:</p>

<p>Causes governing V's:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
1. Habits of the individual.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(a) As to thrift and hoarding.</span><br />

<div class="blockquot"><p>
1. Conditions affecting producers: Geographical differences in Natural Resources; the division of labor; knowledge of technique of production;

<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(d) Business confidence.</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>These two lists are quite different, and indicate that in
Fisher's mind the magnitudes, T and the V's, in general
obey different laws. The only factor in both lists is facilities
for transportation ("rapidity of transportation," in
the first list). Strangely enough, T, though later recognized
as having influence on the V's<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> is not included in
these lists in ch. 5. The "character of the monetary and
banking systems" in the second list is evidently not the
same as "use of checks" in the second list, though it will
doubtless affect that factor, as also the "habits as to thrift
and hoarding," in some degree. "Business confidence,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
which is, in the view I am maintaining, as in the view, I
should take it, of Horace White, the great variable affecting
both T and the V's, does not appear in the first list.
Indeed, one wonders why business confidence appears in
either list, if only "normal," and not merely "transitional"
causes are to be considered, but it appears from the fuller
discussion on p. 78 that Fisher is not thinking of business
confidence as a <i>variable</i> at all&mdash;his normal theory has
nothing to do with <i>variables</i>&mdash;but as a thing which either
is or is not present, a sort of Mendelian unit, not a thing of
degrees.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> It will be noted, further, that most of the causes
which Fisher lists as affecting T are really causes affecting
<i>production</i>&mdash;they would be just as important under a
socialistic as under an exchange economy.</p>

<p>Now I propose to show, on the basis of Fisher's own list
of causes, that most, if not all, of the factors affecting the
V's, will also affect T, <i>and in the same direction</i>. He admits
this as to transportation facilities. It is surely true of
thrift and hoarding. The miser neither circulates money
nor buys goods. It is emphatically true&mdash;though Fisher's
theory, as will later appear, is obliged to deny it,&mdash;of both
book credit and banking facilities. Without the use of
credit, much of the business now done simply would not
be done at all. For Fisher, and the quantity theory in
general, the contention would be simply that the same
business would be done <i>on a lower price-level</i>. I reserve
a full discussion of this fundamental point till later, noting
here, in passing, that the function of banks is to assist in
effecting transfers, that that is why, from the social standpoint,
banks are encouraged, and that the extension of
banking would be folly if they did not, in fact, do this. As<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
to book credit, let us suppose that, for example, in the
great cotton section of the South the stores should cease
to give advances of supplies on credit to negroes and small
white farmers, pending the "making" of the crop. The
outcome would be starvation for many of them, and no
cotton crop at all. Under a system of private enterprise,
the very division of labor itself, including the specialization
of the capitalist, involves credit, and it is difficult to
conceive a form of credit which does not either dispense
with the use of money, or increase its "velocity." Admittedly,
the division of labor increases trade.</p>

<p>The three factors listed under "Systems of payment in
the community" also affect trade. To the extent that
receipts are frequent, regular, and synchronous with outgo,
we have a smoothly working economic system, which
facilitates commerce.</p>

<p>Finally, density of population enormously increases
trade. The concentration of men in cities is essential for
modern factory production, and the great cities have necessarily
grown up about good harbors, or at strategic
points for connecting lines of railroads. It seems almost
trivial to insist on so obvious a point, but Fisher seems totally
to ignore it, for he says: "We conclude, then, that
density of population and rapidity of transportation have
tended to increase prices by raising velocities. <i>Historically
this concentration of population in cities has been an important
factor in raising prices in the United States.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> (P. 88.
Italics mine.)</p>

<p>This is an astounding proposition. It is not merely that
the concentration of population in cities has <i>tended</i> to raise
prices through raising velocities. It is a statement that
this has been an important historical cause of the actual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
increase in prices. For Fisher's own theory, if the same
cause had tended to increase T,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> that would have offset
the rising V's on the other side of the equation, and left
prices little affected. But he sees in the V's an independent
cause here, divorces them from their connection with T,
and follows his logic fearlessly where it leads. I do not
see how one could more strikingly illustrate the essential
vice of erecting the V's into causal entities.</p>

<p>In concluding the discussion of the r&ocirc;le of velocity of
circulation, I think it worth while to mention Fisher's own
efforts to measure them. I examine his statistics in a later
chapter. I do not regard the points at issue as points
which can properly be handled by inductive methods,
primarily. I do not accept his conclusions with reference
to the magnitudes of V, the velocity of money, partly because
I do not accept his doctrine that "banks are the
home of money" (p. 287).<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> He finds for V a fairly constant
magnitude during the thirteen years from 1896 to 1909, the
range being from 19 to 22, the figures for all the years except
1896 and 1909 being interpolations.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> For V, however,
which is much the more important magnitude, from the
standpoint of his equation of exchange for the United
States, since deposits do so much more exchanging than
does money, he finds a wide range of variation, from 36 to
54, and he states: "We note that the velocity of circulation
has increased 50% in thirteen years and that it has
been subject to great variation from year to year. In
1899 and 1906 it reached maxima, immediately preceding
crises" (285). I think Fisher's own statistical results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
show that V&acute;, at least, is a child of the "state of trade."<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
Critical analysis of these statistics show that they greatly
underestimate the variability of the V's.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p>In summary: V and V&acute; are not, as Fisher contends, independent
of the quantity of money. Instead of resting on
"technical conditions," and having large elements of constancy
and rigidity, they are highly flexible, and vary, on
the whole, with the same highly complex and divergent
sets of causes which govern the volume of trade. The
biggest factor affecting the variations of the V's on the one
hand, and volume of trade on the other is business confidence&mdash;a
factor which Fisher's normal theory is not concerned
with, so far as it is considered as a variable, but
which, more than anything else, does affect the concrete
figures which go into the equation of exchange, either for a
single year, or for an average of a good many years. The
V's are not true causal entities, but merely abstract summaries
of a host of heterogeneous facts. I have indicated
before, and shall later demonstrate more fully, that the
same is true of T. Even the "normal" causes governing
the V's, however, are factors which likewise affect T, and
in the same direction.</p>

<p>Among the factors affecting both V and T, there is one
which sometimes makes them move in opposite directions,
and that is the <i>value of money</i> itself. This is so well stated
in Wicksteed's interesting criticism of the quantity theory
that I content myself with a quotation:<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> "Again, the his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>tory
of paper money abounds in instances of sudden
changes, within the country itself, in the value of paper
currency, caused by reports unfavorable to the country's
credit. The value of the currency was lowered in these
cases by a doubt as to whether the Government would be
permanently stable and would be in a position to honor its
drafts, that is to say, whether this day three months, the
persons who have the power to take my goods for public
purposes will accept a draft of the present Government in
lieu of payment. It is not easy to see how, on the theory
of the quantity law, such a report could affect very rapidly
the magnitudes on which the value of the note is supposed
to depend, viz., the quantity of business to be transacted,
and the amount of the currency. Nor is it easy to see why
we should suppose that the frequency with which the notes
pass from hand to hand, is independently fixed. On the
other hand, the quantity of business done by the notes, as
distinct from the quantity of business done altogether, and
the rapidity of the circulation of the notes may obviously
be affected by sinister rumors. Two of the quantities,
then, supposed to determine the value of the unit of circulation,
are themselves liable to be determined by it."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h3>THE VOLUME OF MONEY AND THE VOLUME OF
TRADE&mdash;TRADE AND SPECULATION</h3>


<p>In proving that an increase of money must proportionately
increase prices, it is necessary to prove that the
volume of trade is independent of the quantity of money
and credit instruments by means of which trade is carried
on. Money on the one hand, and quantity of goods to be
exchanged on the other, are the two great independent
magnitudes, whose equilibration mechanically fixes the
average of prices. This notion, as to the essence of the
quantity theory, finds expression in Taussig,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> "The statement
of a quantity theory in relation to prices assumes two
independent variables: total money or purchasing power
on the one hand, total supply of goods or volume of transactions
on the other." Taussig, though he would maintain
that this independence holds, so far as money and trade are
concerned, admits that it breaks down so far as trade and
elastic bank credit, bank-notes and deposits, are concerned.
Trade and elastic bank-credit are largely <i>inter</i>dependent.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
This concession on Taussig's part means virtually giving
up the quantity theory for Western Europe and the United
States and Canada, though Taussig still sees something
left of the quantity theory tendency in view of the "irregular
and uncertain" connection which he finds between
money and bank-credit.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Fisher, however, makes no such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
surrender. He is quite as uncompromising as to the independence
of <i>deposits</i> and trade as he is with reference
to the independence of <i>money</i> and trade. He does, indeed,
make the concession that increasing trade tends
to increase deposits <i>indirectly</i>, by increasing the ratio
of M&acute; to M, by modifying the habits of the people as
to the use of checks as compared with cash (p. 165),<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
but he denies stoutly that there is any <i>direct</i> relation
between them. (P. 168.) Trade acts only <i>via</i> a modification
of the ratio between M and M&acute;, and M still remains
controlled, not by trade, but by quantity of money.
As to any control over T by M&acute;, he repudiates it explicitly,
(P. 163.) Increasing M&acute;, either through an increase of M,
or through an increase in the normal ratio between M and
M&acute;, will have no effect on T,&mdash;or, for that matter, on the
V's. The introduction of credit, therefore, leaves the
quantity theory intact: an increase of M, increasing M&acute;
proportionately, leaving the V's unchanged, and having no
effect on T, must exhaust its influence on P, raising P proportionately,
if the equation of exchange is to remain
valid.</p>

<p>The argument set forth to prove that T is not influenced
by M or M&acute; is as follows: "An inflation of the
currency cannot increase the products of farms or factories,
nor the speed of freight trains or ships. The stream of business
depends on natural resources and technical conditions,
not on the quantity of money. The whole machinery of
production, transportation and sale is a matter of <i>physical
capacities and technique</i>, none of which depend on the
quantity of money. The only way in which quantities of
trade appear to be affected by the quantity of money is by
influencing trades accessory to the creation of money and
to the money metal.... From a practical or statistical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
point of view they amount to nothing, for they could not
add to nor subtract one-tenth of 1% from the general
aggregate of trade." (<i>Loc. cit.</i> p. 155. Italics mine.)
Something similar is said on p. 62, where "transitional"
influences of M on T are being discussed: "But the amount
of trade is dependent, <i>almost entirely</i>, on other things than
the quantity of currency, so that an increase of currency
cannot, <i>even temporarily</i>, very greatly increase trade. In
ordinarily good times practically the whole community is
engaged in labor, producing, transporting, and exchanging
goods. The increase of currency of a "boom" period cannot,
of itself, increase the population, extend invention, or
increase the efficiency of labor.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> These factors pretty
definitely limit the amount of trade that can reasonably
be carried on. So, although the gains of the enterpriser-borrower
may exert a psychological stimulus on trade,
though a few unemployed may be employed, and some
others in a few lines induced to work overtime, and although
there may be some additional buying and selling which is
speculative, <i>yet almost the entire effect</i> of an increase in deposits
must be seen in a change in prices. Normally the
<i>entire</i> effect would so express itself, but transitionally
there will be also <i>some</i> increase in the Q's." (Pp. 62-63.
Italics mine.)</p>

<p>Fisher is here exceedingly uncompromising, even where
transitional periods are concerned, and it is not necessary,
in order to do his position full justice, to make much distinction
between "normal" and "transitional" effects in my
counter-argument. I shall, however, take account of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
distinction as I proceed, in justice to other, more moderate,
quantity theorists.</p>

<p>It is a familiar doctrine that the quantity of money is
irrelevant, that things go on in much the same way whether
money is abundant or scarce, the only difference being that
in the one case prices are high and in the other, low; that,
in particular, it is a gross fallacy to connect the rate of interest
with the amount of money, since (as many writers
would put it) the rate of interest depends on the amount
of <i>capital</i> rather than <i>money</i>. At the opposite extreme, we
have writers like Brooks Adams (<i>Law of Civilization and
Decay</i>), who see the fate of nations and the progress of
civilization resting on the abundance or scarcity of money.
Fisher takes the first position in its extremest form.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>The truth, I think, is intermediate. The effects of the
New World discoveries of gold and silver after the voyage
of Columbus on trade and industry were tremendous.
Trade was enormously increased. Walker, in his <i>Inter</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span><i>national
Bimetallism</i>,<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> asking, from the standpoint of a
quantity theorist, why prices only increased 200% while
money increased 470%, admits that the chief reason was
the increase in trade, due in large part to the very increase
in money itself. Sombart, in his <i>Der Moderne
Kapitalismus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> finds in this influx of money a tremendous
source of capitalistic accumulations, (a) for the Conquistadores,
(b) for the handicraftsmen whose prices rose
faster than their costs, (c) for tenants whose rents were
fixed in money, (d) for landowners, whose rents were fixed
in kind [a point not obviously true], and (e) for bankers,
as the Fugger. An increase of capital, savings that would
otherwise not have been made, must have profoundly
modified the whole industrial system, and greatly increased
both industry and commerce. If it be objected
that effects of this sort are not usual, that they came in a
world which had been starved for money, and which, by
means of the enormous increase in money was able to pass
from a "natural" to a money economy, I reply that the
difference between such a case and the usual effects of an
increase of money are in degree rather than in kind. The
world of Columbus' day was in part on a money economy,
and the world to-day, despite Professor Fisher's emphatic
denial,<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> still employs a great deal of barter, or equivalents
of barter. I shall revert to this point later. But even
this consideration would not rob Sombart's points of their
significance for modern conditions. Further, we have an
even more striking case, on Walker's own showing, in the
effects of the Californian and Australian<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> gold discoveries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in the 19th Century on trade, industry, and speculation.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Nor is the tremendous agitation over bimetallism, involving
a literature so great that no man could dream of
reading it all, involving great political movements, Presidential
campaigns, great Congressional debates, repeated
legislation, international conferences, etc., for twenty years,
to be explained on any other ground than that the world
felt practical, important, and unpleasant effects on industry
and trade from the inadequacy of the money supply.</p>

<p>The view of Hartley Withers<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> is interesting here. He
says: "any such great addition to currency and credit
would have a great effect in stimulating production, and
so would lead to a great addition to the number of real
goods which humanity desires and consumes when it can
get them.... Trade would be more active." On p. 23
he speaks of the enormous expansion of trade made possible
by paper representatives of gold. On p. 83 he speaks
of the attitude of the money-market toward gold, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the orthodox economist is apt to think of as a survival of
Mercantilism. Withers thinks that the money market is
right in a large degree.</p>

<p>As illustrating Withers' statement about the views of
"practical men" on this point, the following extract from
a recent address by Theodore Price, quoted with approval
in a "market letter," written by Byron W. Holt,<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> is interesting:
"The fact seems to be that the exigencies of war
in Europe are leading to an extension of credit such as
would not have been possible in peace, because the hesitant
conservatism of bankers would have then prevented it,
and we are finding that instead of working harm it is doing
good, because huge masses of fixed capital are thereby
made productive, and are circulating with the increased
velocity that always quickens enterprise and accelerates
the wheels of industry.... All the precedents of history
indicate that accelerated activity will come with peace and
continue until the exuberance of success has led men to
build faster than the world has grown and to demand
credit upon the basis of future rather than of present
values."</p>

<p>What is the essential causation in the matter? Well,
viewed merely as a matter of mechanical equilibration, the
quantity theory view is not strictly true, by any means.
For a given country&mdash;and Fisher's quantity theory is
always a theory for a given country, and, indeed, for any
separate market, even a single city<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a>&mdash;an increase of banking
credit means an increase in non-monetary capital,
because, to a greater or less extent it dispenses with the
use of gold, which goes abroad, bringing back wealth in
other forms in exchange. Adam Smith saw this clearly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and phrased it strikingly, likening gold and silver coins to
the wagon-roads of Scotland, which are necessary for
transportation, but which none the less prevent the use of
the roadways for raising grain; whereas bank credit is like
a wagon-road through the air, which restores the roadbeds
to cultivation. Increased non-monetary capital, other
things equal, should mean increased trade.</p>

<p>But, more fundamentally, an increase in gold itself
within the country, if not bought by the export of an
equivalent amount of other goods, <i>is an increase of capital</i>.
Not all capital is money, but standard coin is capital.
Money is a tool of exchange, and exchange is part of the
productive process. More money means more exchanging.
That is what money is for. Part of the mechanism is in
the money rates, which go down as money becomes more
abundant, making it profitable to effect exchanges which
would not have been profitable had the money rates been
higher. Granted that the money-rates and the general
rate of interest tend, in the long run, to keep&mdash;I will not
say at the same figure<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>&mdash;a certain fairly definite relation
to one another, it still does not follow that the new "normal"
equilibrium will give us an interest rate which is the
same as the general rate of interest was before the influx of
gold. On the strictest static theory, this is not to be expected.
Because the total amount of capital in the country
is increased, and this means a lowered interest rate all
around, in the marginal employment of capital. The
margin of the use of capital will be lowered everywhere, including
the margin for the use of money. This means
permanently lowered money rates in the country, even
though the permanent level be higher than the initial<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
money rates immediately following the access of new gold.
I have put the argument in terms that suggest the productivity
theory of interest, because it is more simply
stated that way. I do not accept the productivity theory,
as a fundamental explanation of interest, but for many
purposes, the results to be obtained by it coincide with the
psychological time theories,&mdash;which also, in their present
form, seem to me imperfectly developed. I need not try
to construct a theory of interest here, however, as the
familiar theories lead to no trouble at this point. It is
enough to point out that the increased amount of capital,
meaning better provision for present wants&mdash;wants concerned
with gold in the arts and with money for productive
exchanges, as well as goods generally since part of the new
gold will be exported for other things&mdash;will lessen the pressure
of present as compared with future wants, and so
lessen the rate of interest on the time-preference theory.
The final outcome will be an extension of the marginal use
of money, and a greater volume of exchanges. Of course,
the increase in the supply of any kind of capital good, apart
from a prior increase in the demand for its services, will,
on the mechanical view of economic causation, necessarily
lead to some fall in its capital value. Gold money will be
no exception to this rule. As to how much the increase
in its quantity will lead its capital value to fall, however,
we are unable to say. For the quantity theory, the fall will
be in proportion to the increase. For the theory just outlined,
the fall will depend on the elasticity of demand for
gold in the arts, and on the elasticity of "demand" for
money, meaning by demand for money simply the demand
for the short-time use of money as a tool of exchange, a demand
which governs <i>directly</i>, not the capital value of
money, but rather the "money-rates." The relation between
the money rates and the capital value of money will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
best be discussed at another point.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> We have no reason
at all to suppose that either of these demands<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> exhibits
the tendency to obey the law of proportional variation
which the quantity theory requires of money.</p>

<p>It is further important to note that as a country gets
more abundant capital, there seems to be a tendency to
extend the use of money rather more than the use of
many other capital goods. Where the interest rate is 10
and 12%, as in Arizona and New Mexico, money, even
when brought in, tends to leave in large degree to bring
in other forms of capital which the situation calls for
more imperatively. The early American colonies, needing
money pressingly, and making shift with a great variety
of substitutes for good metallic money, thoroughly acquainted
with the advantages of a money-economy from
their European experience, and having "habits" as to the
carrying and using of money which they had brought with
them from Europe, still found it impossible to keep a great
deal of metallic money, in view of the still greater importance
of other forms of capital. It is in the most highly
developed commercial communities, commercial centres,
and <i>par excellence</i>, in the speculative centres, that the demand
for the money-service is most elastic.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> A country
where the rate of interest is low, loses other forms of capital,
and gains money, in the process of re&euml;quilibration, as compared
with a new and undeveloped section, although the
new section also extends the margin of the money service,
in effecting a greater number of exchanges, when money is
increased.</p>

<p>And this leads to a vital distinction, which quantity theorists
almost always lose: the distinction between the volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
of <i>production</i>, and the volume of <i>trade</i>. Even in the mechanical
system of causation which they describe, it is true only
of production and transportation that <i>technical</i> and <i>physical</i><a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
factors are of primary significance, and that money
is of minor significance. For trade and commerce, money
is always highly important. To the extent that a region
is primarily given over to the primary productive activities,
mining, and agriculture, such trading as is necessary
can be done by means of a small amount of money, supplemented
by barter and long-time book-credit. A region
or a city whose chief business is <i>commerce</i>, however, needs
a large part of its capital in the form of money, and of
banking capital, which is largely invested in money for
banking reserves. <i>Trade</i>, as distinguished from industry
(and it is after all trade that is under discussion), is helped
or hindered as its tools are more or less abundant. These
considerations would suggest that the elasticity of the demand
for the use of money is greater than the elasticity of
demand for the use of capital in almost any other form.
Production is, indeed, limited by labor supply and natural
resources, in considerable degree. <i>Trade</i>,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> however, even
from the standpoint of mechanical causation, is limited
chiefly by the relation between the profits to be made in
commercial transactions, and the "price" that must be
paid for the money and credit that are required to put
them through. There are enormous numbers of transfers
that could be made to advantage if there were no cost at all
involved. They are not made, because exchanging requires
pecuniary capital. Let the pecuniary capital in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>crease,
however, and sub-marginal exchanges become
worth while, the general margin is lowered. Commerce
is the most highly flexible and elastic portion of the whole
productive process. The elasticity of demand for commercial
capital is, thus, greater than the elasticity of demand
for any other form of capital.</p>

<p>How widely the volume of trade differs from the volume
of production, and how great is the element of speculative
transactions in trade, will best appear, I think, from an
analysis of the figures which Fisher gives<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> for the volume
of trade in the United States. His figure for the volume
of trade in the year 1909 is $387,000,000,000.00, three
hundred and eighty-seven billions of dollars! This figure
is reached by equating the figures he has reached for MV
plus M&acute;V&acute; to PT, and assuming P to be one dollar, by
making the "unit" of T, arbitrarily, a dollar's worth of
each sort of commodity, at the prices of 1909. I have
already commented on the legitimacy of this method of
summarizing T,<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> and need not say more here, beyond
calling attention to the fact that "volume of trade," as
commonly used, does in fact mean, not T alone, but PT.
Fisher for years other than 1909, however, makes use of a
different method of getting at T: he takes certain indicia
of <i>relative</i> amounts of trade, compares them with the same
indicia for 1909, and estimates the trade for other years as
being such a percentage of the trade for 1909 as their indicia
are of the indicia of 1909. The indicia chosen are: (1) quantities
of certain commodities, cotton, fruit, cattle, etc., <i>received
at</i> principal cities of the United States, taken as
typical of the variations of the internal <i>commerce</i> of the
United States; (2) quantities of 23 articles of import and 25
articles of export, for each year, taken as typical of varia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>tions
in the foreign trade of the United States; (3) sales of
stocks. These three indicia, weighted in a manner to be
described in a moment, are then averaged. There is a
second element in the index, made up by taking the figures
for railroad <i>tonnage</i>, and the figures for <i>receipts on first class
mail</i>, which are averaged. The first average and the second
average are then combined into a third average, which
is the final index. The relation between this index for every
year other than 1909 and the same index for the year 1909
determines the amount of T for each year&mdash;the two indicia,
together with the figure, $387,000,000,000.00, giving the
required amount by the "rule of three." I shall not go
into details with the method of constructing these averages,
but I wish to make clear the comparative <i>weight</i> given to
each element in the final index: The first three elements count
<i>twice</i> as heavily as the last two, and so constitute the biggest
factor. In the first average, based on the first three elements,
the item taken as typical of internal trade is <i>weighted
by 20</i>, the item taken as typical of foreign trade is <i>weighted
by 3</i>, and sale of stocks <i>by 1</i>. It appears from Fisher's
figures (p. 479), that the one really big <i>variable</i> among all
the indicia is the sale of stocks, but the weight given it is
so small that it makes virtually no difference in the final
result. Thus, as between 1898 and 1899, stock sales increased
over 50%, but total trade, as shown by Fisher,
increased only 5%. In the following year, stock sales <i>decreased</i>
over 21%, but total trade, on Fisher's figures, <i>increased</i>.
The following year, 1901, stock sales virtually
doubled, but Fisher's final figure shows only an increase
around 13%. Two years later, in 1903, stock sales fell off
about 40%, from the figures for 1901, but again, as compared
with 1901, total trade on Fisher's figures shows an
appreciable gain. The influence of stock sales on Fisher's
index is, virtually, negligible. The dominating factor is the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
<i>receipts</i> of selected staples, cattle, cotton, rice, pig iron, etc.,
in the principal cities of the United States. There is not a
<i>single year</i> in which his final figure for T does not move in
harmony with this factor (p. 479). He gets, thus, for the
volume of trade through the fourteen years under consideration,
a surprising steadiness, and a pretty uniform progressive
development.</p>

<p>In defence<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> of his method of weighting, Fisher says,
simply: "These weights are, of course, merely matters of
opinion, but, as is well known, <i>wide differences in systems
of weighting make only slight differences in the final averages</i>."
(Italics mine.)<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

<p>Are these figures valid? Well, first one is struck with
the absolute magnitude assigned to T. The figures seem
vastly greater than would have been anticipated. The
method of calculating it, for 1909, I shall discuss in detail
in the chapter on "Statistical Demonstrations of the
Quantity Theory." For the present, it is enough to note
that the absolute magnitude is derived from figures col<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>lected
by Dean David Kinley for the National Monetary
Commission,<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> of deposits, exclusive of deposits made by
one bank in another, made in about 12,000 banks (out of
25,000) on March 16, 1909. These deposits were classified
as (1) money (with subdivisions) and (2) checks and other
credit instruments. A cross-classification divided them into
(1) retail deposits; (2) wholesale deposits; (3) all other
deposits. Kinley's object was to determine the extent
to which checks are used, as compared with money, in payments,
particularly in wholesale and retail business. Fisher's
total, briefly, was obtained as follows: Kinley's figures, for
the one day, were increased to make an allowance for the
non-reporting banks; they were further increased on the
assumption that March 16 was below the average for the
year; the figure finally obtained for the day was then multiplied
by 303, assumed as the number of banking days in
the year, and the product, 399 billions, was taken as representing
the total circulation of money and checks in trade.
For some reason not made clear, this total was subsequently
reduced to 387 billions. Counting the average price, P,
as $1, T was considered to be 387 billions.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>In the statistical chapter to follow, it will be shown that
this estimate is a very decided exaggeration. Deposits
made in banks greatly overcount trade. Very many payments
represent duplications, loans and repayments, taxes,
etc., and are in no sense trade. This is true of all classes
of deposits, wholesale and retail, as well as "all other."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
But for the present, I am concerned with the question, not of
the absolute magnitude of the volume of trade, but rather,
the questions of its character, of the elements that enter into
it, and, above all, of the extent to which it is physically determined
by technical conditions of production, and the extent
to which it is flexible, a matter of speculation, etc.</p>

<p>We may approach this question from the angle of several
bodies of statistical information. First, the question may be
raised: what is there in the country which could be bought
and sold enough in the course of a year to give us anything
like so great a total? The subtractions which we shall find
it necessary to make will still leave us an enormous total.</p>

<p>The United States Census Bureau<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> in 1904 reached the
conclusion that the <i>total wealth</i> of the country was only
$107,000,000,000. Of this, over $62,000,000,000 was in
real estate; $11,000,000,000 in railroads; street railways,
over $2,000,000,000; telephone, telegraph, water and light,
and similar enterprises total nearly $3,000,000,000 more.
None of these things enter into ordinary wholesale and retail
trade. The items that one would ordinarily think of
are agricultural products, $1,900,000,000; manufactured
products, $7,400,000,000; mining products, $400,000,000.
Can these things be exchanged often enough in the course
of a year to account for $387,000,000,000!</p>

<p>These figures are for 1904,<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> whereas Fisher's figures are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
for 1909. If the Census Bureau had taken an inventory
in 1909, the figures would doubtless be larger. The inventory
for 1912 made by the Census Bureau does show a
very considerable increase, the largest item being due to a
rise in real estate values. The figures for agricultural,
manufacturing, and mining products are, also, figures for a
given time rather than for total production through the
year. But, making all the allowance one pleases, it is
quite incredible that one should reach a figure of $387,000,000,000
by taking only the exchanges necessary to bring
raw materials through the various stages of production
to the consumer. The greater part of the $387,000,000,000
is to be explained in another way!</p>

<p>A detailed analysis of Kinley's figures, on which the
estimate of total trade is based, leads clearly to the same
conclusion. Kinley's figures for the banks that reported
on March 16, 1909, are as follows:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="5" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'>Retail deposits</td><td align='right'>60 millions</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>Wholesale deposits</td><td align='right'>124 millions</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>"All other" deposits</td><td align='right'>502 millions</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The "all other deposits" are vastly greater than retail
and wholesale deposits combined! Notice, too, with
reference to the question as to how often goods need to be
turned over in getting to the consumer: wholesale trade
uses only about twice as much money and checks as does
retail trade. Goods are not, if these figures are in any way
typical of actual trade, turned over many times in the
process of reaching the consumer. The "necessary," or
"physically determined" number of exchanges, in the
routine of trade, is small, per item.</p>

<p>Retail deposits of 60 millions make up less than one-eleventh
of the total. Retail and wholesale deposits together
make up about three-elevenths. What is the other eight-elevenths,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
represented by the "all other deposits"? It
will help if we see where these "all other" deposits are
located. If we find them scattered evenly throughout
the country, in rural regions as well as in cities, we might
be at a loss. If, however, we find them bunched in the big
speculative centres, we may conclude that speculation
accounts for a large part of them. We do in fact find this.</p>

<p>The following figures show the different classes of deposits
(1) in the South Atlantic States; (2) in reserve cities;
(3) in New York City alone:</p>

<p>It is difficult, with Kinley's figures, to get figures which
exclude returns from cities of substantial size, except for a
State like Nevada, where the mining and divorce industries
complicate the figures. As near an approach as can be
made, perhaps, is to take the State of Louisiana, excluding
New Orleans from the totals. Even here, however, we
include five cities of over ten thousand, among them
Shrevesport, with 28,000 people. The following figures
are for the State and national banks in Louisiana, exclusive
of New Orleans:</p>

<p>We cannot tell, in these figures for Louisiana, how many
banks are represented, or what the average figures per
bank are. For the whole State of Arkansas, however, including
five cities of over 10,000, with two over 20,000, and
one of 45,000, we can get an average for ninety reporting
banks. Even here we do not know where these banks are
located within the State; though it is probable that they
are in the larger places, and so exceed the average deposits
for the banks in the State as a whole, to say nothing of the
average for the smaller places. The ninety banks are
almost wholly State and national banks.</p>

<p>The average for all deposits, per bank, in Arkansas is
$10,224; the average for all the 11,492 banks reporting for
the whole country is, approximately, $60,000; the average
for the 659 banks reporting from New York State is $502,136;
the average for the banks in New York City alone
is doubtless much higher, but cannot be stated, as Kinley's
figures do not tell how many banks reported by cities.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>The "all other deposits" in Arkansas are 27.8% cash,
and 72.2% checks; the "all other" deposits in the country
as a whole are only 4.1% cash, with 95.9% checks; the "all
other deposits" of New York City are only 1% cash, with
98.9% checks.</p>

<p>Several facts are very clear from these comparisons: (1)
the proportion of "all other deposits" increases very
rapidly as we get closer to the great centres of speculation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and is lowest in rural regions; (2) the great bulk of all the
deposits is in the cities. The average for Arkansas banks,
for example, is only one-sixth the average of the whole
country, and is only one-fiftieth the average for the banks
of New York State. It is a much smaller fraction of the
average for New York City, but we cannot give an exact
figure. The totals reported from the rural regions are
trifling, as compared with the totals reported from the big
cities. This, as will be made clear in the chapter on "Statistical
Demonstrations of the Quantity Theory," is not
because the country reports were less complete that the
city reports. New York was probably less complete than
the country as a whole. It is simply because the activity
of country accounts is small, the amount of trading in the
country districts small, and (as shown) the <i>average</i> for
country banks is small. (3) The character of the "all
other" deposits in Arkansas differs substantially from that
of the "all other" deposits in New York City, as indicated
by the fact that the proportion of cash is high in Arkansas&mdash;substantially
higher, in fact, for the "all other" deposits
in Arkansas than for all deposits, or even for retail deposits,
in the country as a whole. The percentage of checks in
total retail deposits in the United States, in Kinley's
figures, was 73.2; the percentage of checks in the "all other"
deposits in Arkansas was 72.2. We may count these
Arkansas "all other" deposits as, in considerable degree,
deposits made by farmers. What were the "all other deposits"
made in New York City?</p>

<p>Dean Kinley's list of the miscellaneous elements that
enter into the "all other deposits," given on p. 151, contains
only two that might be expected to bulk large in New
York without appearing in Arkansas. These are: <i>brokers</i>,
<i>and stock and bond financial corporations</i>. Of course,
theatres, hotels, publishing houses, railroads, public funds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
"those who have no specific business," and rich churches,
will all be absolutely much larger in New York City than in
Arkansas. But these things may be found in many places,
scattered throughout the cities of the country, without
making anything like such "all other" deposits as New
York shows. It is not New York's foreign commerce
that does it, because that is represented in New York's
"wholesale deposits," which make up only 14% of New
York City's total deposits for the day. It cannot be the
supposed "clearing house" function of New York City,<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
whereby banks in different parts of the country pay
their balances due one another in New York exchange, because
such transactions would appear in New York chiefly
in the figures for deposits made by one bank in another, and
these figures are excluded from Kinley's totals. It cannot
be the deposits of the "idle rich" for current expenses that
swell New York's "all other deposits" so greatly&mdash;these
could not equal the total retail deposits of the city, which
are only 3.7% of the total in New York. Moreover, similar
deposits are made in many other cities, without, in
proportion to population, making any such totals. Figures,
moreover, for the aggregate yearly income of the
United States, and for the distribution of that income between
rich and poor, make it clear that any such items must
be bagatelles in comparison with these enormous figures.
The only explanation that will really explain is the speculative
and investment and financial transactions that centre
in New York, and, in less degree, in the other great financial
cities of the country.</p>

<p>This is Dean Kinley's opinion. In the "all other" deposits
he makes a 50% allowance for speculative transactions.
"A large proportion of deposits in this 'all others'
class undoubtedly represents speculative transactions, all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
of which, or practically all of which, are settled with credit
paper."<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> It is also the opinion of General Francis A.
Walker, expressed concerning similar figures from earlier
inquiries.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>Various kinds of evidence converge toward this conclusion.
Thus, the evidence of clearings, total items presented
by banks to the clearing houses of the country.
New York clearings are usually nearly twice as great as
total clearings for the rest of the country. New York
clearings fluctuate in general harmony with transactions
on the New York Stock Exchange. This has been commented
on many times. The extent to which it holds
has recently been carefully measured by Mr. N. J. Silberling,
whose results appear in the <i>Annalist</i> for August 14,
1916, under the title, "The Mystery of Clearings." Mr.
Silberling applies the "coefficient of correlation" to the
problem, getting in one significant figure a measure of the
extent to which two variables, as share sales on the New
York Stock Exchange and New York clearings, vary together.
This coefficient has been used enough by economists
not to require detailed explanation here. It is a
figure always between +1 and -1. +1 indicates that
the two variables in question are perfectly correlated,
whereas 0 indicates no correlation whatever. -1 indicates
an inverse correlation, such that two variables vary
exactly and inversely with reference to one another.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>Mr. Silberling's studies show the following correlations:
New York share sales (numbers of shares, not values) to
New York clearings, using weekly figures, for the years
1909-10, r = .628. This is a high correlation. Limiting
the observations to the middle weeks of the month for the
same period, he gets r = .731(46). The reason for taking
only middle weeks in the month is that thereby the disturbing
factor of monthly settlements is avoided. The
monthly settlements may be for stock transactions, or
may be for other things, but as they are not dependent on
the stock transactions <i>of the week</i> in which they occur, their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>effect is to lessen the evident degree of connection between
stock sales and clearings. Thus the middle weeks show a
closer correlation between the two variables than do all the
weeks taken as they come. If figures for the month were
taken, this complication would be smoothed out, and a
fairer result might be expected to appear. The middle
weeks, eliminating monthly settlements, probably eliminate
more other things than they do share sales (which are in
large degree paid for in 24 hours<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>), and so exaggerate somewhat
the relation between shares and clearings. Monthly
figures avoid both complications, though they lose something
of the concrete causation. An intermediate figure
might be expected for the monthly correlation, and this we
find: r = .718(23).</p>

<p>A striking single fact in connection with these figures,
giving them point as less extreme variations could not do,
is found in the behavior of clearings when the Stock Exchange
was closed, during the crisis of 1914. At that
time, New York clearings, which had been about twice as
great as country clearings, fell suddenly <i>below</i> country
clearings. When the Stock Exchange was opened, the old
proportions suddenly reappeared.</p>

<p>That speculation spreads far beyond New York, New
York being the centre for dealings in securities, etc., which
involve the whole country, is, of course, well known. The
extent of this Mr. Silberling seeks to measure by correlating
clearings outside New York with New York share sales.
His weekly correlation for these two variables for 1909-10
gives r = .368(103), and the correlation for the mid-weeks
gives a higher figure, r = .424(46). The monthly correlation
shows r = .257(23), a lower figure, "which is perhaps
due in part to the fact that the bulk of the outside monthly
clearings show relatively moderate fluctuations, because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
of their diverse composition, and are less sensitive than the
periods of shorter length."</p>

<p>Seeking an index of the variations of that trade which
is, in Professor Fisher's phrase, governed by "physical
capacities and technique"&mdash;a law which Professor Fisher,<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
as we have seen, would apply to the great total of 387 billions
which he has constructed&mdash;Mr. Silberling chooses the
gross earnings of the principal railways as the best available
test. Railways deal with all manner of other enterprises.
He correlates this with clearings outside New York. "The
question might arise at once whether changes in traffic
are strictly concomitant with changes in payments involved
by it, and therefore with the clearings resulting. The preliminary
hypothesis that a 'lag' ensued between traffic
and the bulk of the payments was first tested by correlating
the railway figures with clearings of one month<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> and two
months later, but no correlation was obtained. The
direct month-to-month correlation yielded, however, a
result r = .524(23)." This suggests that outside clearings
are, in substantial degree, an index of physical trade, but
Mr. Silberling calls attention to certain chance agreements
between railway traffic and speculation in cotton and
produce and grain, speculation in the crops which are in
current movement, and regularly recurring concomitances
between traffic and speculation in March, when the railway
traffic revives after the February lull, and when there is
a large mass of dealing in Spring deliveries in Chicago. In
view of the facts later to be developed, with reference to the
small actual value of the necessary physical exchanges
(partially covered already) as compared with clearings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
this query is well put. We may easily have here a "spurious"
correlation. Taking it at its face value, however,
and taking the correlation as indicating the influence of
physical trade on bank transactions, we get the following
results, when <i>total clearings for the country</i> are compared
with (a) New York share sales, and (b) with railway gross
earnings: (a) r = .607(23); (b) r = .356(23). "Physically
determined trade" is at best a minor factor in that total
"trade" represented by bank transactions!</p>

<p>Mr. Silberling has buttressed his results with a consideration
of various alternative possibilities which might give
them a different interpretation. I need not, for present
purposes, go further into his figures.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Taken in conjunction
with the other data presented, and to be presented,
together with the theoretical discussion of the nature of
trade, and its relations to money and credit, which the
present volume contains, they give the present writer
abundant confidence in the thesis that the great bulk of
trade in the United States is <small>SPECULATION</small>, rather than
that sort of trade which is determined "by physical capacities
and technique."</p>

<p>The figures given above, of the inventory of wealth at a
given moment of time, by the Bureau of the Census, show
only trifling magnitudes, as compared with the estimated
387 billions of deposits made in 1909, of items which could
enter into ordinary trade, as distinguished from speculation
and dynamic readjustments. An effort to calculate
ordinary trade on the basis of figures running through the
year may throw further light on the problem. Railway,
gross receipts for the year ending June 30, 1909, were less
than two and a half billions. This is six-tenths of 1%<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
of the total. Receipts of the Western Union Telegraph
Company were $30,451,073&mdash;less than one-hundredth of
1%. The Post Office in the fiscal year ending in 1909 took
in $203,562,383. This is something over one twentieth
of 1%. These are gigantic sums. But they are insignificant
indeed in this computation. Millions of smaller items
simply do not count at all&mdash;ten million items of $387 each
would give only 1%. The total net income of the United
States, as estimated by W. I. King for 1910, including all
forms of income, dividends, interest, wages, rents, profits,
salaries, etc., is $30,500,000,000<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a>&mdash;around 7% of the 387
billions.</p>

<p>Let us sum up the major items of ordinary trade. From
Kinley's figures, we may get some idea of the proportions
of wholesale and retail trade to the total for 1909, assuming
that the deposit figures indicate that total. Retail deposits
make up less than one-eleventh of the total, and wholesale
deposits about two-elevenths. The figures were: retail,
60 millions, wholesale, 124 millions, and "all other," 502
millions. But the "all other" deposits were lower than
normal. New York City was, in the first place, probably
less complete than the rest of the country, in the figures returned,
and, in the second place, New York City, as shown
by the clearings of March 17 (the next day, when checks
deposited in New York would get into the clearings) was
28% below normal. The rest of the country was within
3% of normal.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Not to refine matters too much, we shall,
on the assumption that the variable element in New York
deposits is connected with the Stock Exchange (as shown
by Mr. Silberling's correlations and other considerations),
and on the assumption that deposits connected with the
stock market appear in the "all other" deposits, add a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
over 20% of New York's total of 198 millions, or 40 millions,
to the "all other" deposits for the country, leaving the
wholesale and retail deposits unchanged. What error there
is in this is favorable to the wholesale and retail deposits.
Our proportions, then, are: retail, 60, wholesale, 124, "all
other," 542, total, 726. If the retail deposits correctly
represented retail trade, we could then say that retail
trade was a little less than one-twelfth of the whole, and
wholesale trade about one-sixth. But there are many
speculative transactions engaged in by wholesalers, and a
good many by retailers. The writer knows a small delicatessen
dealer on Amsterdam Avenue, in New York, who frequently
speculates in eggs and canned goods. A colleague
in the Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration
is authority for the statement that speculation in canned
goods and some other things is quite common among retailers,
particularly "hedging" by the use of "futures," in
canned goods. Speculation among wholesalers is very
extensive. The same is true of manufacturers. The
same authority cited some cotton manufacturers whose
profits from cotton speculation are greater than their profits
from manufacturing. We shall see reason to suppose that
a very substantial part of manufacturers' deposits were included
in the wholesale deposits. That the figures for retailers'
deposits exaggerate the retail trade may appear
from several considerations: (1) The proportion of checks
to cash reported is too high: 73.2%. Dean Kinley allows
5% of the checks deposited to be "accommodation
checks,"<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> cashed for customers, rather than taken in
in trade. (2) If retail deposits are taken as exactly representative
of retail trade, we should get a retail trade
for the year of over 32 billions (<small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>12</sub></small> of 387 billions), which
would exceed the total income of the country as calculated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
by King for 1910. Dean Kinley reached the conclusion
that the retail deposits reported in 1896 also exceeded the
probable retail expenditures.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Of course, not all of retail
trade is in consumption goods. Hardware stores, lumber
stores, and some other retail establishments sell, not only
to householders for domestic use, but also things which
enter into further production, and so do not come out of
annual income. If we include in retail trade various items
which were not included there in Kinley's figures, such as
hotels, theatres, newspaper receipts from subscription and
street sales, physicians' fees, etc.&mdash;all those items which
enter into the domestic budget, including domestic service,
we should still not be justified in reaching a total as great
as the total income of society, since there would then be no
allowance for savings, which we should not count in trade,
or for life insurance, which we shall count separately. The
items sold at retail which enter into further production
cannot make a great total, since large producers buy such
things at wholesale. Total retail trade, therefore, and, in
addition all the other items in the domestic budget, must
be held below the figure for total national income. Suppose,
to be very liberal, we allow 29 billions<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> for all these
items, under the general head of "retail trade."</p>

<p>For wholesale trade, if we take the figures at face value,
the estimate would be 65&frac34; billions (<small><sup>124</sup>/<sub>726</sub></small>
of 387 billions, or 17% of 387 billions). But we have seen that
there is a great deal of speculation among wholesalers.
Not all of their deposits, by any means, represent receipts
from ordinary business. Moreover, there is much overcounting
here, several checks being used for one transaction,
especially where wholesalers have branch houses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
and checks connected with loans and repayments, and
transfers of funds from one bank to another. How much
we should subtract for this there is no way to tell.
In the case of retail figures, we have the additional
check of the figures for total net income, but there is no
such check here. We shall, therefore, make no subtraction,
but shall content ourselves with pointing out that we
are allowing many billions<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> to "ordinary trade" to which
it is not entitled, which will much more than offset errors
in the opposite direction which the reader may find in our
computations.</p>

<p>Do manufacturers' receipts from first sales belong in the
wholesale deposits, or must they be counted as a separate
item? Dean Kinley does not say. In his list of items, as
reported by banks, that go in the "all other" deposits,<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> he
does not mention manufacturers, and the item is far too
important not to have been mentioned by so careful a
writer had he supposed that it belonged there. If manufacturers'
first receipts belong, not in the wholesale deposits,
but in the "all other" deposits, then we should expect
manufacturing cities to show a high percentage of "all
other" deposits as compared with wholesale deposits. The
city of Pittsburg should be a good test case. The figures
there, for State and national banks and trust companies, are:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="8" summary="">
<tr><td align='left'></td><td align='right'>&nbsp;</td><td align='right'><i>Per Cent.</i></td></tr>

<tr><td align='left'>"All other" deposits</td><td align='right'>6,672,378</td><td align='right'>60.6</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>For Pittsburg, the percentage of "all other" deposits
is lower decidedly than the percentage for the country as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
a whole (about 75%), much lower than for cities where
there is active speculation, as Chicago and St. Louis, to say
nothing of New York, and is closer to the percentage of the
South Atlantic States, 52%, than to the average for the
country. The wholesale deposits of Pittsburg, however,
rise to 29.7%, as against an average for the country of
17%. There is nothing in these figures to suggest that
manufacturers' first receipts are exclusively in the "all
other" deposits. I should think it safe to hold that a substantial
part of them were included in wholesale deposits,
and so already accounted for in our estimate. The total
value of products manufactured in 1909 was $20,672,051,870.
I shall allow $5,672,051,870 of this to have been
already accounted for in our estimate of wholesale trade,
and count 15 billions of it as a separate item. If there is
an error here, it is very much more than offset by our
failure to subtract anything from the wholesale figures for
speculation. I think it probable that much more of the
figures for manufactures should be assigned to the wholesale
figures than I have assigned.</p>

<p>To these figures, we may add a number of other items,
absolutely great, but insignificant, in comparison with the
387 billions not only, but also with the figures for retail
and wholesale trade already reached. These are: total
farm value of farm products (not nearly all of which is sold
off the farm) $8,760,000,000; total mineral products,
$1,886,772,843; total mill value of lumber, $684,479,859;
total life insurance premiums (much of which is savings,
and in no proper sense trade), $748,027,892; total fire,
marine, casualty and miscellaneous insurance, $362,555,850;
total wages and salaries, $14,303,000,000; total land
rent, $2,673,000,000;<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and the items for railway gross re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ceipts,
post office, telegraph, already mentioned. The
total of these items, together with retail and wholesale
trade and manufactures, is $141,860,618,000. This is
only 36.6% of the total of 387 billions. It leaves over
245 billions unexplained. What can the 245 billions represent?
There is really no way in which ordinary trade
can make up more than a very few more billions, so
far as I can see. There remain no items as big as 1%
of the total, and, as we have seen, small items, of
hundreds of dollars each, are like "infinitesimals of the
second order"&mdash;they simply do not count at all when such
staggering figures are involved.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>There remains, then, a total of 245 billions of check and
money payments which are for something other than the
ordinary trade of the country. What do these payments
represent? Much of this total represents overcounting
and duplications of various kinds, which we shall consider
in a later chapter. Much of it also represents speculation
and dealings other than speculative in securities. When
we seek to find actual figures of transactions in any field,
retail, wholesale, or speculative markets, or anything else,
it is exceedingly difficult to find anything that approaches
the amounts indicated by the banking transactions connected.
I do not think that a record of all sales would
show retail sales or wholesale sales anything like so great
as the figures as we have allowed for them on the basis of
the retail and wholesale deposits. When we look at the
recorded figures of transactions on the speculative exchanges
(or at estimates which competent observers make
when records are not available), the figures, though very
large, do not begin to equal the banking figures with which
we have to deal. The New York Stock Exchange in 1909
showed sales, recorded on the ticker, of nearly 215 million
shares of stock, with an approximate value of over 19 billions<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>
of dollars. This was not an extraordinary year.
In 1901 nearly 266 million shares were sold, in 1905, over
263 millions, in 1906, over 284 millions. A number of
other years have approached the figures for 1909. If
stock sales be a good index of general speculation, 1909 is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
very satisfactory year from which to have got figures, as
showing neither extreme speculation, nor extreme dullness&mdash;which
latter was the case in 1896 when Kinley's other
big investigation was made. The figures for shares sold,
however, do not exhaust the business done at the New
York Stock Exchange. "Odd lots," <i>i. e.</i>, sales of less than
100 shares, are not recorded on the ticker. Mr. Byron W.
Holt estimates that from 25 to 30% would be added if they
were counted. DeCoppet and Doremus, of New York,
who handle at least as much of the "odd lot" business
as any other New York house, have given me the
following information about the "odd lot" business: (1)
the volume of odd lot sales is, roughly, from 20 to 25%
of the volume of hundred share sales; (2) the odd lot
business fluctuates in conformity to the hundred share
market; (3) the odd lot speculator is just as likely to be a
"bear" as is the hundred share speculator, and, in general,
odd lot business is like the hundred share business. If we
take the figure on which these two estimates agree, 25%,
we may add 53&frac34; million shares to our 215, getting
268&frac34; million shares for 1909, with a value of about 24
billions. Bond sales recorded would add about 1 billion
more. There are, further, some unrecorded sales, indeterminate
in amount, but sometimes very substantial,
when brokers have a number of "stop loss" orders. They
match these before the market opens, and, if the prices are
reached in the actual trading, these sales become effective
automatically, without getting on the ticker. How extensive
this is cannot be stated. It may sometimes add
very substantially.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> Thus, on the floor of the New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
Stock Exchange we have dealings in excess of 25 billions
for 1909. This is nearly as large as the figure we have assigned,
on the basis of the bank figures, to total retail trade
of the country, and it may well exceed the retail trade in
fact. Recorded sales on other stock exchanges do not, in
the aggregate for the country, bulk very large. For 1910,
when New York shares reached 164 millions, the total for
Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Baltimore was something
over 21 million shares.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The New York Curb has
had "million share" days, but the average value of shares
is low. But the dealings on the floors on the exchanges
and "curbs" are far from all of the dealings in securities!
Only securities which have been admitted by the authorities
are dealt in on the exchanges. The volume
of unlisted securities is enormous. Moreover, not all,
by any means, of the sales of listed securities take place
on the floors of the exchanges. The bond expert of a
large banking house in Boston informs me that the "over-the-counter"
business in Boston, both for stocks and for
bonds, much exceeds the business in the Boston Stock Exchange,
and others among Boston brokers have expressed
the same opinion. The statement has been repeatedly
made in the financial press that of the bonds listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, ten are sold over the counter
for one sold on the floor. Evidence on this point is not to
be had in definite figures, of course, but I have found no
one in Wall Street who regards it as extravagant. A
single big bank in New York sold $550,000,000 in bonds in
1911&mdash;more than half the recorded bond sales on the Stock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
Exchange.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> I should not know how to estimate the volume
of outside dealings within many billions of "probable
error." If ten billions of listed bonds are sold over the
counter in New York alone, we may well suppose that the
volume of over-the-counter sales of listed and unlisted securities
at least is not smaller than the recorded sales on the
floors of the exchanges. But this is all guess work. There
are no definite data.</p>

<p>For produce, cotton, and grain speculation we have, in
general, estimates rather than records. For the Board of
Trade, in Chicago, there is one quite striking piece of information.
That is that the Federal War Tax of 1 cent
per hundred dollars on grain and provision futures on the
exchanges produced $2,000,000 in Chicago alone in 1915.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
For the purposes of the tax, deliveries within thirty days
were counted, not as futures, but as "spot" transactions.
The tax was collected almost wholly on grain. If the
above figure is correct, then it is clear that dealings in these
futures of over thirty days aggregated 20 billions of dollars
worth. This gives no estimate of spot transactions, which
are, however, very great. All this trading involved less
than 400,000,000 bushels of grain received at Chicago&mdash;a
little over a billion bushels were received at all primary
markets. The grain received at Chicago was, thus, (at
80c. per bushel), sold sixty-two times over in these futures,
and an unknown number of times in spot transactions.
There are further enormous spot transactions in provisions
of various kinds at Chicago.</p>

<p>Chicago is the great centre, of course, for this kind of
speculation in the United States. It may well be the
world's chief market, so far as futures are concerned, though
evidence to establish such a thesis is not at hand. London<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
and Liverpool are gigantic centres of commodity speculation.
But we have numerous cities in the United States
where such speculation is very great. St. Louis, Kansas
City, Minneapolis, New Orleans, and other cities are active
speculative centres. New York, while small in its volume
of grain and produce speculation as compared with Chicago,
is the world's centre for cotton speculation, and the world's
centre for futures in coffee, though yielding precedence to
Havre, Santos and Hamburg,<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> ordinarily, in the volume
of spot coffee transactions, and though handling only a
very small amount of spot cotton. The volume of cotton
sold in an ordinary year in New York is 50,000,000 bales,<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
though only about 160,000 bales are ordinarily received
there, in a year.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> In the five years preceding 1909, the
sales on the New York Coffee Exchange averaged over 16
million bags of 250 pounds each.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> In 1915, 32 million
dollars were deposited as margins in connection with this
speculation in coffee, and in ordinary years this runs from
25 to 30 millions, according to the Treasurer of the Exchange.
The relation between the margins put up and the
total pecuniary volume of trading is not indicated, but in
most exchanges the actual depositing of margins is a small
fraction of the pecuniary magnitude of the turnovers.
Both the Cotton and the Coffee Exchanges are international
centres. The Coffee Exchange now handles large transactions
in sugar, also.</p>

<p>Contacts between the organized exchanges and ordinary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
business are very numerous. Producers in every line who
can do so protect themselves by "hedging" in the exchanges
which deal in their raw materials. This is a commonplace,
so far as millers are concerned. The writer has found
millers in a town off the main lines of the railroads in Missouri
who regularly sell short a bushel of wheat on the St.
Louis Merchants' Exchange for every bushel they buy to
grind. The business man who does not sometime take a
"flier" in the market for other than hedging purposes is
rare! But, apart from the organized markets there is an
immense volume of speculation. If a wholesaler buys only
what he can sell to retailers, it is not speculation. But
if he buys in excess of the anticipated demands of his retailers,
expecting to sell the excess at an advance to other
wholesalers, he is speculating. If a farmer buys cattle to
feed, he is not speculating, but if he buys them thinking to
sell them at an advance in a short time, and does so, the
transactions are speculative. The line is not easy to draw,
in practice. Intention is shifting and uncertain. There
is chance in every industrial, commercial, and agricultural
operation. But for the point at hand, the test is simple:
do more exchanges take place than are necessary, under the
existing division of labor, to advance the materials of industry
through the stages of production, and get things
finally to the consumer? If so, the excess of exchanges
is speculative. Trading between men in the same stage
of production is speculation. It represents trading to
smooth out dynamic changes, to bring about readjustments
which would have been unnecessary had conditions really
been static, and had the initial plans of enterprisers been
adequate. Trading in anticipation of further trading
with men in the same stage of production is speculative.
This sort of thing, in the wholesale business, especially, is
exceedingly common. This has been noted by Professor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
Taussig, and made by him an important point in the theory
of crises. Dean Kinley<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> called attention to it as a matter
of importance in connection with his investigation in 1896.
The coming of cold storage, and the development of the
canning industry have, I am informed by a colleague in
the Harvard Business School, enormously increased this
speculation among both wholesalers and retailers, and it is
very important in most wholesale lines. There is short-selling
in materials for construction purposes, and in metals,
apart from organized exchanges, and, where possible, contractors
in the building trade often protect themselves by
means of future contracts with speculators who are selling
short.</p>

<p>Land speculation, in varying volume, is found in every
part of the country. There is speculation in leases, in
options on real estate, and in options on leases.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> It may
be noticed, too, that sales of "rights," of puts and calls
and straddles, and other contract rights, are regular factors
in the organized exchanges. Wherever profits are to be
made by leveling values as between different places or
different times, speculation arises, and, with dynamic
change, this means everywhere, in every business, and all
the time! The shifting of labor and capital from industry
to industry, leveling returns to capital and labor, involves
an enormous amount of trading that would not occur in a
"normal equilibrium." Much of this the Stock Exchange
does. That is what it is for. But much of it has to do
with unincorporated industry, and a vast deal of speculative
exchanging takes place to this end apart from the organized
exchanges.</p>

<p>Speculation in bills and notes, by note-brokers and par<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>ticularly
by dealers in foreign exchange, occurs on a large
scale, and accounts for a great deal of the banking figures.
This has nothing to do with physically determined trade.
From the standpoint of Professor Fisher's "equation of
exchange," it must be barred, if the contention that "trade"
is determined by "physical capacities and technique" is to
be adhered to. Speculation in demand finance bills is
barred in any case, since "money against checks," and
"checks against checks," are excluded by his definition.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
But as an explanation of no small part of our unexplained
245 billions of dollars, these items must be brought in.
They are "double counting" from the standpoint of Professor
Fisher's equation. They are, however, speculation.
An official in a great New York banking house, in charge of
the foreign exchange department, writes that in times when
exchange rates are fluctuating, enormous quantities of
drafts on Europe will be bought and sold, during a period
of a couple of weeks or months, whereas under other conditions
such transactions might amount to little with the
same volume of imports and exports. The part of this
which is between banks, a very big item, would not count
in the 245 billions, but to the extent that foreign exchange
brokers outside the banks participate, their activity helps
to explain our 245 billions.</p>

<p>If it be true that speculation, including all manner of
readjustment to dynamic changes, makes up the overwhelming
bulk of trade in the country, then Fisher's <i>indicia</i>
of variation in trade, weighted as they are, are totally misleading.
The same is true of Kemmerer's <i>indicia</i> of
"growth of business."<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> These are: population, tonnage
entered and cleared, exports and imports of merchandise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
postal revenues, gross earnings of railways, freights carried
by railways, receipts of the Western Union Co., consumption
of pig iron, bituminous coal retained for consumption,
consumption of wheat, consumption of corn, consumption
of cotton, consumption of wool, consumption of wines and
liquors, market values of reported sales on the New York
Stock Exchange. Only the last of these is in any sense an
index of speculation. It is swallowed up by being put on a
par with the other fourteen items. Its influence on the
final index, made by averaging the others is, as inspection
shows, virtually <i>nil</i>. Out of the twenty-six years his
figures cover, the general index moves counter to the share
sales 14 times! Utterly random figures would have come
nearer to the facts in the case. It is particularly striking
that Professor Kemmerer, whose total figures, as Professor
Fisher's, rest for their absolute magnitude on Kinley's
investigation,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> should assign 89% of his estimated
trade (183 billions in 1890) to wholesale commodities,<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
(with 3% to wages, and 8% to securities), when Kinley's
figures show that wholesale deposits are a minor fraction
of the total!</p>

<p>The constancy in the figures of these two writers for
trade from year to year, a general steady, upward growth,
does indeed suggest that trade is determined "by physical
capacities and technique," and that it does stand as a great,
independent, inflexible factor, independent of money and
deposits, constituting a real causal coefficient with them in
determining prices. If, however, speculation is as big a
factor as our analysis would indicate, then trade is a highly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
flexible thing, varying enormously from year to year,
moved by a multiplicity of causes, among them <i>fluctuations</i>
in particular prices, and the ease and tightness in the
money market&mdash;the quantity of money and deposits.</p>

<p>But quite apart from speculation, it is not true that trade
is a mere matter of physical capacities and technique, a
passive function of production. Rather, one would almost
have to reverse the relation. Production waits on trade!</p>

<p>Production, as now carried on, is primarily conducted in
the expectation of <i>sale</i>, and of profitable sale. Trade does
not go of itself, automatically. Rather, it is a highly difficult
matter, calling for the highest order of ability, and the labor
of innumerable men. In general, I think it safe to say that
in ordinary times, the manufacturer loses vastly more sleep
over the question of how he shall market his output, than
he does over the question of how he shall produce it. A
clerk in the Westinghouse Air Brake Company, engaged
in the accounting department, spoke recently to the writer
of the "productive end" of the business. On inquiry, it
developed that he meant the selling department! He
stated that the manufacturing department also, in the
language of the employees, in that corporation, would also
be termed "productive," but that the selling department
was <i>the</i> productive department.</p>

<p>If one reflects a little as to the proportion of "costs" that
go into selling, as compared with technical "production," I
think my point will be clearer. Advertising has developed
so enormously that it needs little discussion. It has been
stated that the "Sapolio" people once tried, after their
reputation seemed thoroughly established, to stop advertising,
with such disastrous results that very extraordinary
efforts were required to re&euml;stablish the brand. Number 2
wheat is not advertised, in the great magazines, but innumerable
brands of flour get newspaper and magazine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
advertising,&mdash;some of them in such a periodical as the <i>Saturday
Evening Post</i>, and even those which are locally consumed
are commonly advertised in the local press. Nor is
it only finished products, of the sort that must be sold to
the fickle public, that involve these heavy selling costs.
The writer has in mind a corporation producing a high-grade
type of glazed retort, in the production of which it
has virtually a monopoly, since the clay with which it is
made does not coexist with the skill to make it in any other
place. The particular product is an indispensable part of
many important technical processes. Substitutes made of
other clays, and by other companies, are known by the
trade to be unsatisfactory. The buyers are all highly
trained business men. Here, if anywhere, selling costs
should be slight. But the chief selling agent of the corporation
has found it necessary, in order to keep the business
going, to incur huge expenses for entertaining his customers,
finds it necessary to incur great travelling expenses, to use
only the most expensive hotels, and, incidentally, to drink
a great deal more than his personal inclinations would call
for, in keeping the business for his house. I waive discussion
of the extraordinary fees which a trust promotor
makes, in effecting a consolidation of big business units,&mdash;a
process of exchange. I am speaking now of the ordinary
costs involved in ordinary trade. The army of travelling
salesmen, the body of stenographers, who write letters,
with various "follow-ups," in the effort to get more business,
the growing complexities of such letter writing, in
which all suspicion of "circularizing" must be allayed, one-cent
stamps being absolutely taboo!&mdash;these things are the
commonplaces of business. They are in the primers in
the "commercial colleges" and "schools of commerce."
Only the orthodox economist, with his doctrine of the impossibility
of general overproduction, is ignorant of them!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>This feature of modern business has been much elaborated
in a recent book which has not received the attention
it merits&mdash;though its strength is rather in criticism than in
constructive doctrine. I refer to Dibblee, <i>The Laws of
Supply and Demand</i>.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> Dibblee makes an interesting contrast
between commercial and manufacturing cities, maintaining
that the former necessarily outgrow the latter&mdash;a
contention which London, New York, Chicago and other
places strikingly illustrate. He presents a truly remarkable
fact about London:<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> a recent report of the Commission
on London Traffic states that there were in London
638 factories registered as coming under the Factory Acts,
with an average horse-power of 54. The total power employed
within the London area under the Factory Acts,
chiefly used in newspaper printing, was 34,750 horse-power&mdash;just
one-half of what is required for the steamship,
Mauretania! This is the greatest city in the world. What
do its millions do for a living?<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The town of Oldham,<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> he
asserts, with 100,000 inhabitants, has spindle capacity
enough to supply more than the regular needs of the whole
of Europe in the common counts of yarn. To <i>market</i> the
output of Lancashire, "the merchants and warehousemen
of Manchester and Liverpool, not to mention the marketing
organization contained in other Lancashire towns, have a
greater capital employed than that required in all the manufacturing
industries of the cotton trade." Accurate
estimates of the proportion of "selling costs" to costs of
technical production are doubtless impossible, for the gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>eral
field of trade, and precision is unnecessary for my purposes.
Dibblee's conclusion, after contrasting retail and
wholesale prices, and analyzing the expenses incurred in
selling prior to the wholesale stage, is that the cost of
marketing is at least equal to "real cost of production,"
occasionally only slightly below it, and often far above it
(62).<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> If one considers how large the item of "good will"
often bulks in the value of "going concerns"<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>&mdash;good will
being in large degree often just a capitalization of prior
costs of this nature&mdash;Dibblee's estimate need not be exaggerated.
Trade connections, trade-marks that have reputation,
etc., often represent enormous output in thought,
work, and expense. Selling costs may, like other costs, be
divided into "prime" and "overhead" costs. Some of
the latter lead to long-time consequences, pay for themselves
only in the long run. These may be "capitalized"
in "good will."<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Of course, not all good will is got at a
cost. Much of it is adventitious.</p>

<p>In the light of the doctrine that trade is independent of
money and credit, one wonders why it should be thought
necessary to extend branches of American banks to the
South American markets which we are now reaching out
toward. And why have Americans, from the beginning,
been constantly increasing commercial banks?<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> It is easy
to sneer at the efforts of the successive frontiers in our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
history to provide themselves with banks of issue as based
on a delusion, the delusion that bank-notes are "capital,"
and to say that their real need was, not more bank-credit,
but more real capital. They needed more tools and live-stock,
doubtless, but is that the whole story? And were
their banks of no assistance in getting the additional capital
of various sorts? And was it a matter of no consequence
that they had an abundant medium of exchange? It
seems almost childish to put such questions, but the quantity
theory has as its logical corollary that to multiply
banks is quite useless and wasteful, since the only result is
to raise prices. If increasing bank-credit cannot increase
trade or production, this corollary is inevitable. Indeed,
the case may be more strongly stated. Quite apart from
the wasted labor of bank-clerks and the waste of banking
capital, the effect of increasing bank-development, on
quantity theory reasoning, is harmful. If increasing bank-credit
is to raise prices without increasing trade, then, on
quantity theory reasoning, it must <i>depress</i> business. The
reason is that rising prices in a given region make that
region a bad place to buy in, and so curtail its exports.
This is, indeed, the quantity theory explanation of international
trade, to which attention is later to be given. The
country which is expanding its banking facilities most
rapidly will suffer most in competition in the world markets.
This is why the United States have so little foreign trade!
It also explains the rapid strides that China and Central
Africa have recently made in capturing the world's markets.
I submit that there is no flaw in this argument, if the
premise of the independence of volume of trade and volume
of bank-credit be granted. It follows from the quantity
theory. That it is no caricature of Fisher's argument will
appear, I think, from the following quotation,<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> which very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
nearly states what I have just been saying, though it does
not draw the conclusion that banking is a bad thing: "The
invention of banking has made deposit currency possible,
and its adoption has undoubtedly led to a great increase
in deposits and consequent rise in prices. Even in the
last decade the extension in the United States of deposit
banking has been an exceedingly powerful influence in that
direction. In Europe deposit banking is in its infancy."<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
Happy Europe, troubled only by war! It is greatly to be
hoped, in the interests of American agriculture, that the
efforts to increase agricultural credit facilities will fail!</p>

<p>We are driven to one of the most fundamental contrasts
in economic theory, which appears under various guises
and in different forms: statics <i>vs.</i> dynamics; transition <i>vs.</i>
equilibrium, theory of prosperity <i>vs.</i> theory of goods; normal
tendency <i>vs.</i> "friction."<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> Perhaps Professor Fisher,
and the quantity theorist in general, would dismiss many
of these considerations as not applicable to the general
principle, which is a "normal" or "static" or "long
run" law, not subject to considerations of this sort. It is
scarcely open to Fisher to defend himself this way, because
of his exceedingly uncompromising statement regarding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
even "transitional" relations between volume of trade and
money and credit. I shall not reply to anyone who offers
such an objection by a general tirade against "static economics."
I believe thoroughly in the method of economic
abstraction, and in reaching general principles by ignoring,
provisionally, in thought the "friction" and "disturbing
tendencies" which often make the first approximations
look somewhat unreal. But I raise this question: to
what feature of our economic order do we chiefly owe it
that we can make such abstractions? By virtue of what
does friction disappear? What is it that makes our abstract
picture of economic life, as a fluid equilibrium, with
its nice marginal adjustments, its timeless logical relations,
correspond as closely as it does to reality? The answer is:
<small>MONEY</small> and <small>CREDIT</small>.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>It is the <i>business</i>, the <i>function</i>, of money and credit, as
instruments of exchange, to bring about the fluid market,
to overcome friction, to effect rapid readjustments, to give
verisimilitude to the static theory, to make the assumptions
of the static theory come true. Where exchange is easy
and friction slight, there will not be two prices for the same
good in the same market. Speculators, seeking profits of
fractions of a point, will prevent that. By multiplying exchanges,
they will level off values and prices. Because
money and credit have done their work so thoroughly in
the "great market," it is possible for men to talk about
static theory, and to work out economic laws in abstraction
from friction, transitions, and the like.</p>

<p>In the static state, all speculation is banished. There
are no price-fluctuations to be smoothed out, no new prospects
to be "discounted," no uncertainties to be guarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
against by "hedging." Seasonal goods will, of course,
have to be carried over from one season to the next, but
this will involve merely warehousing and the use of capital&mdash;"time
speculation," involving many sales, does not come
in. One sale to the capitalist who carries the seasonal
goods, with a sale by him to the man who means to use
them, will suffice. It has been shown before that the great
bulk of trade is speculation. But speculation is banished
from the static state. Speculation is a function of dynamic
change, waxing and waning with the degree of uncertainty
that exists, the new conditions to which readjustments
have to be made, the "transitions" that have to be effected.
In other words, the laws governing the volume of trade are
dynamic laws, laws of "transition periods," and so the
whole notion which underlies the quantity theory, of
"normal periods," "static" relations, etc., is here irrelevant.
Volume of <i>trade</i>, as distinguished from volume of <i>production</i>,
is controlled by the number and extent of the "transitions"
that have to be made. The chief work of money
and credit is done <i>in</i>, and <i>because of</i>, "transition periods."
Assume a normal equilibrium accomplished, and you have
little trading left to do. It will still be necessary, if you
have the division of labor, and private enterprise, for goods
to pass through as many different hands as there are different
independent enterprisers in the stages of production,
and on, through merchants, to the consumer. It will still
be necessary to pay wages, rents, dividends and interest.
But there will be no selling of lands, of houses, of factories,
of railroads, or of securities representing these. By hypothesis
these are already in the hands best qualified to hold
them. The "static equilibrium" presents "mobility without
motion, fluidity without flow."<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> The static picture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
is a picture of completed adjustment, where no one has an
incentive to change his work, or his investments, because
he has already done the best that he can for himself. It
is, therefore, a picture of a situation where there is little
incentive for those exchanges which make up the great
bulk of the volume of trade in real life.</p>

<p>Hence the curious phenomenon that very much of static
theory has been developed in abstraction from <i>money</i> and
<i>credit</i>. Mill's theory of international values, for example,
abstracts from money. "Since all trade is in reality
barter, money being a mere instrument for exchanging
things against one another, we will, for simplicity, begin
by supposing the international trade to be in form, what it
is in reality, an actual trucking of one commodity against
another. So far as we have hitherto proceeded, we have
found the laws of interchange to be essentially the same,
whether money is used or not; money never governing, but
always obeying, those general laws."<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Other writers
have similarly held that money is a mere cloak, covering
up the reality of the economic process. Schumpeter, for
example, holds that money is, in the static analysis, merely
a "Schleier," and that "man nichts Wesentliches &uuml;bersicht,
wenn man davon abstrahiert."<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> <i>On the static as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>sumptions</i>,
of the fluid market, with friction, etc., banished,
money is, indeed, anomalous and inexplicable. It is a
cloak, a complication, a vexatious "epi-phenomenon."
There is nothing for it to do, and there can be, consequently,
no "functional theory" developed for it. Static
theory may be ungracious in ignoring its own foundation.
But static theory is grotesque when it seeks to support its
own foundation! Static theory is possible only on the
assumption that the work of money and credit has been
done. What, then, shall we say of static theory which
seeks to explain the work of money and credit? Yet precisely
this is what is undertaken by the quantity theory,
with its "normal" or "static" laws of money and credit.
A functional theory of money and credit must be a dynamic
theory. To talk about the laws of money, "after the
transition is completed" is to talk about the work money
will do after it has finished working. For a functional
theory of money and credit, we must study the obstacles
that exist to prevent the fluid market. We must study
friction, transitions, dynamic phenomena.</p>

<p>To this problem we shall come in Part III. For the
present, I am content to have disproved the quantity
theory contention that the volume of trade is independent
of the quantity of money and credit.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX TO CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h3>THE RELATION OF FOREIGN TO DOMESTIC
TRADE IN THE UNITED STATES<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></h3>


<p>The word, "trade," as used in connection with statistics
of foreign and domestic trade has been irritatingly ambiguous.
Few writers, in speaking of domestic trade, have
meant the same thing by trade that they have meant by
the word when speaking of foreign trade, and hence we
have had many pointless efforts to institute comparisons
between the two, and some very misleading statements
about the matter. Thus, figures have been offered which
would show that the foreign trade of the United States
is only a fraction of 1% of the domestic trade. This conclusion
is reached by taking the figures for banking transactions
discussed in Chapters XIII and XIX as representative
of domestic trade, and comparing them with the
annual figures for exports and imports. This procedure
is fallacious for several reasons:<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> the figures thus reached
for domestic trade exceed even the total trading within the
country, as shown in Chapter XIX. In the second place,
as shown in Chapter XIII, the bulk even of these deposits
which do represent real trading grow chiefly out of speculation.
Even in ordinary trade, goods are counted several
times before reaching the final consumer. It is clear,
therefore, that even an accurate figure for total trading
within the country would have little relevance when we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
are seeking a figure to compare with exports and imports.
Nor, if a comparison of the actual trading in which foreigners
participate with the trading exclusively between
Americans is sought, can we take the export and import
figures as representative of the foreign trading&mdash;they do
not include a multitude of highly important transactions
in which foreigners participate. Very much of the business
of the New York Cotton Exchange, the New York
Stock Exchange, the Chicago Board of Trade, and other
speculative markets represents foreign buying and selling,
especially arbitraging transactions, and the other "invisible
items" of foreign trade need merely to be mentioned for
the economist to recognize the fallacy of a comparison
which omits them.</p>

<p>What figures are relevant when we wish to compare
foreign and domestic trade? First we must make clear
the purpose for which the comparison is to be made. If
we are concerned with the calls made by foreign and domestic
trade on the money market, we should make use of
a different method of comparison than that which will be
here employed. The purpose of the comparison here undertaken
is to determine how much of our American labor,
land and capital is at work producing for the foreign consumer,
as compared with the land, labor and capital in
America producing for the American consumer. The
comparison here undertaken is concerned with the question
which is usually uppermost in the minds of those who
undertake such a comparison, namely, <i>how important</i> is
our foreign market to us? Obviously, for such a comparison
as this, we should not count a given case of eggs
twelve times merely because it changed ownership twelve
times in getting from farm to breakfast table. Items of
export and import count only <i>once</i> in the figures for export
and import. We must find a figure for domestic "trade"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
in which items count only once, allowing no turnovers of
the same goods to swell the total, if we wish to make our
figures comparable.</p>

<p>The method proposed for making this comparison, for a
long series of years, is a modification of the method used
by the writer in an article in the <i>Annalist</i> of Feb. 7,
1916. A figure based on the bank deposits of <i>retail merchants</i>
in Kinley's 1909 investigation was there taken as
properly comparable with the export and import figures.
The final sale to consumer by retailer is "the one far off
divine event" toward which the whole productive process
moves. Everything else in production and exchange looks
forward to this. Ultimately, from the demand of the
final consumer comes all the demand that is directed
toward the agencies of production, even though the laborer
sees his immediate market in the person of the employer,
and the capitalist or landlord sees his immediate market
in the person of the active business man. The figure
reached for retail trade by the method then employed was
$34,500,000,000 for 1909. This figure was too high, as
shown in Chapter XIII above, and the figure reached now
for retail <i>deposits</i> by the same method is $32,000,000,000.
Even this figure is too high, however, as I there concluded,
to represent retail <i>trade</i>, and I shall use it only as a check
on King's figure for <i>the total income of the United States in
1910</i>, which I shall use as a base figure instead of my own.
King's figure for the total income of the United States in
1910 is $30,500,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> I take this figure as including
all that the American people spend for consumption, with
retailers, physicians, hotels, theatres, etc., and also their
net savings for the year. Part of this they spent for foreign
products. The rest they spent at home. This residue
spent at home gives us a figure which we may properly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
compare with the amount the foreigner spends in America,
as indicating the ratio of foreign to domestic trade for the
purpose in hand. We subtract, in other words, from the
figure for total income the figure for <i>imports</i>. Then we
compare the residue with the figure for <i>exports</i>, and get
our ratio of foreign to domestic trade. The export and
import figures must first, however, be reduced to a <i>retail</i>
basis. That is, assuming that wholesale prices are two-thirds
of retail prices, we add 50% to the figures for exports
and imports (which are wholesale figures) before making
the subtraction and the comparison. The ultimate consumer,
both in Europe and America, pays for imports and
exports on a <i>retail</i> basis.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> This method, applied to the
figures for 1910, gives us a ratio of about 10:1 for domestic
to foreign trade&mdash;the lowest percentage for foreign trade
which we shall find for any year in the period investigated,
1890-1916.</p>

<p>This comparison is still unfavorable to foreign trade.
Domestic trade, in our figures, includes savings and investments,
including investments made by Americans abroad.
Import figures are marred by undervaluations, exports are
not all counted, and the figures for exports and imports
do not include foreign investments in America. American
investments abroad should not be counted as part of domestic
trade. Moreover, our figures take no account of
travellers' expenditures, or of services performed by professional
men of one country for men in another, or of certain
other "invisible items." But while this makes our
percentage for foreign trade too low for all years, it probably
does not greatly upset the results for yearly variations in
the ratio except for the year 1916, when the figure for domestic
trade is left decidedly too high, and the ratio for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
foreign trade is too low, as compared with previous
years.</p>

<p>For years other than 1910, indirect calculations must be
resorted to for domestic trade. I have substantial confidence
in the rough accuracy of the figure chosen for 1910
in view of the convergence of two widely different sets of
data. My figure for retail deposits in 1909 is $32,000,000,000.
King's figure for total income is $30,500,000,000 for
1910. King's figure seems to me a better figure to use for
the purpose in hand. I use my own merely as a rough
check on his. For years other than 1910, the figure for
net income is calculated as a percentage of King's figure
for 1910, by means of an "index of variation." It is
assumed that the net income of 1905, for example, bears
the same relation to the index for 1905 that the absolute
figure for net income of 1910 bears to the index for 1910,
and net income for 1905 is then computed by "the rule of
three." The index of variation chosen is <i>railway gross receipts</i>
weighted by <i>wholesale prices</i>. I think that railway
gross receipts are, on the whole, the most dependable and
easily manageable index of physical volume of production
that we have, though recognizing difficulties, later to be
discussed, in using them for the purpose in hand. Railroads
touch virtually every kind of business in the country.
Variations in the <i>pecuniary</i> volume of production and consumption,
however, if due to rising or falling <i>prices</i>, rather
than to changing physical volume, would not be indicated
by changes in railway gross receipts. The same volume
of transportation might represent widely varying pecuniary
values of goods transported. Railway rates do not vary
from year to year with prices of goods, even though high-priced
goods are normally charged higher rates than low-priced
goods. The index, therefore, must include <i>prices</i> as
well as physical volume of transportation. For 1910,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
therefore, railway gross receipts and an index of prices are
multiplied together, and counted as 100%. The same
thing is done for railway gross receipts and prices for other
years, and the results reduced to percentages of the result for
1910. The figure for net income in any other year is then
readily computed as a percentage of the figure for 1910.
The results, for the years 1890-1916, appear in the tables
below.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be noticed that my figures for net income in 1900
and 1890 do not correspond very closely with the figures
for the same years as independently estimated by King.
My figure for 1900 is $12,900,000,000, where his is $17,965,000,000;
for 1890, my figure is $9,300,000,000, where his is
$12,082,000,000. I am inclined to the view that the figures
in my tables come closer to the facts for these years than
do his figures, assuming that <i>his figure</i> for 1910 is correct.
It will be noticed that on his figures there was an increase
of about 50% from 1890 to 1900, and an increase
of only about 66% in the decade following. This seems
to be an unlikely relation. One would expect a much
greater rate of increase for the decade 1900-10, as
compared with the preceding decade, than King's figures
show. The period from 1890 to 1900 included the terrible
panic of 1893 and the prolonged depression ensuing. The
panic in 1907 was trifling in comparison, and recovery, as
shown by our index numbers in the tables below, was very
much quicker. Moreover, falling prices characterized
much of the earlier decade. The highest prices of the
whole ten years were in 1891. The period from 1900 to
1910 is a period of rapidly rising prices, on the whole. On
the basis of our general knowledge of the two periods, one
would expect a greater percentage gain by far for the second
decade, and I therefore trust the results of the index of
variation here chosen, which show that. Similar results
are obtained by applying to the base figure for 1910 an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
index of variation derived from Kemmerer's and Fisher's
figures for trade<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> and prices. My figure for 1890 may,
moreover, be checked by comparison with the figure given
by C. B. Spahr in <i>The Present Distribution of Wealth in the
United States</i> (p. 105) for the net income of the country for
that year: $10,800,000,000. It may be that my figure for
1890 is too low, but I have not sought to "doctor" it by an
arbitrary "correction factor" to make it correspond more
closely than it does with the other estimates. It is striking
enough that a figure derived from an index of variation,
twenty years away from its base, should come as close as
this to figures calculated from wholly different data.</p>

<p>One brief comment may be made on the significance of
these figures. It may be questioned if figures showing the
proportions of our industry devoted to supplying goods
for the foreign market correctly indicate the importance
of the foreign market to us. It may be urged that if we
should lose our foreign market, we should merely turn to
producing more for the domestic market, and that the loss
would not be the whole of our receipts from foreign trade,
but merely the cost of transition, and the loss that comes
from shifting to production to which we are less suited.
This is, doubtless, true. But the loss reckoned this way
may well be greater than the loss reckoned on the basis of
my figures! It is equally true, moreover, that our domestic
trade is not important to the extent indicated by my
figures, since if we lose part of our domestic trade, our producers
will turn to supplying more for the foreign market.
But one must not regard the cost of transition as a negligible
matter! The cost may easily be prolonged depression.
Certain parts of our foreign trade are really vital to us, both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
on the import and (to a less degree) on the export side.
The most important practical use to which the figures here
given may be put are in connection with short-run problems.
Foreign trade is so important to us that any sudden
alteration in its amount may bring great adversity or great
prosperity&mdash;as the course of the present War abundantly
testifies.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a></p>

<p>An application of our method to the years 1850 and 1860
gives a percentage for foreign trade of 12.7 in 1850, and 16.0
in 1860.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<p>Certain other cautions are needed in presenting these
figures. For one thing, variations in railway rates will
make a given volume of gross earnings mean different
things in different years as to the physical volume of traffic.
In the writer's opinion, which is confirmed by Professor
W. Z. Ripley, there is no possible way of making allowance
for this, as the cross-currents affecting railway rates are
altogether too numerous and obscure. Nor has any effort
been made to allow for variations in the proportions of
freight and passenger receipts, or of different classes of
freight traffic.</p>

<p>Again, the proportions of railway traffic connected with
foreign trade may vary greatly, and it may happen that a
big increase in railway gross receipts is due to increasing
foreign trade, primarily. There is reason to suppose that
much of the increase of 1916 is to be explained that way.
This makes our comparison for 1916 particularly adverse
to foreign trade, since we count as domestic trade what is
really foreign trade. The figures, however, are presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
as they stand. Moreover, for 1916, the great increase in
foreign trade is in <i>exports</i>. Merchandise imports are not
much greater than in previous years.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> Our exports have
been chiefly paid for by "invisible items," gold and securities,
and short term credits. These do not appear
anywhere in our figures. A substantial source of error
appears from this cause in our 1916 figure. I should think
it safe to put the ratio for foreign trade to domestic trade
for 1916 at above 20%, instead of the 17.9% our table
shows.</p>

<p>The reader will wish to know for a given year how much
of the increase or decrease is due to physical growth of
business, as represented by railway gross receipts, and how
much is due to changes in prices. To give this information,
and to make it easy for a critic to check the results,
a table showing the index numbers from which the figures
for net income are computed is subjoined.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h3>THE VOLUME OF TRADE AND THE VOLUME OF
MONEY AND CREDIT</h3>


<p>In the argument so far I have said nothing of the reverse
relationship, the dependence of the volume of money and
the volume of credit on trade. The two are indeed <i>inter</i>dependent.
Interdependence suggests circular theory,
and is often a phrase to cover circular reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> In the
case of the relation under discussion, however, I have, I
trust, already abundantly protected myself against the
charge of circular reasoning by <i>denying</i> that either volume
of money and credit on the one hand, or volume of trade
on the other hand, is a true cause at all. Both are mere
abstract names, designating highly heterogeneous individual
occurrences, which, <i>individually</i> are cause or effect.
In general, both volume of money and credit, on the one
hand, and volume of trade on the other hand, are results
of common causes, which are the <i>ver&aelig; caus&aelig;</i> of economic
phenomena&mdash;values, psychological phenomena. The whole
thing is to be explained immediately and primarily in
terms of social relationships and mental processes,&mdash;in
terms of social values.</p>

<p>To show that increasing trade tends to increase money
and credit is not difficult. If one may venture a hypothetical
illustration&mdash;and the sort of hypothetical illus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>trations,
like the dodo-bone case, of which quantity theorists
are fond make one hesitate to do so&mdash;let us assume a
communistic community, isolated from other markets,
with a developed system of production, including an extensive
use of gold in the arts. Let the communistic r&eacute;gime
gradually pass over to an individualistic r&eacute;gime. Assume
that the inhabitants are acquainted with the use of
gold as money, and that their government is willing to coin
it freely. As individualism spreads, and trade grows, will
not more and more gold be taken to the mints? I am not
here concerned with the principles determining the apportionment
of gold between the money employment and the
arts. It is enough to show that expanding trade tends
to increase the volume of money.</p>

<p>Assume that the money supply meets difficulties in its
expansion. Is there not at once an incentive to extend
credit? The seller finds his customers unwilling to buy for
cash, in amounts as great as before. In order to sell as
much as before (assuming that the use of credit is known,
to avoid trouble with historical origins), he extends credit,&mdash;which,
when practiced generally, lightens the strain on
the money supply.</p>

<p>I have so far said nothing of the case where there are
stocks of the money metal to be got from outside markets.
But if a country is expanding its trade, does not money
come in? The quantity theorists would, indeed, admit
this, in general, though their reason is a bad one, namely:
that expanding trade lowers prices, and lower prices make
the market attractive to foreign buyers, who then send in
money for the goods. I shall later discuss this aspect of
the theory.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> For the present, I merely interject the question
as to the probability of an expansion of trade when
prices are falling. Increasing <i>stocks</i> of particular goods may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
well mean lower prices for these goods and if they be
articles of export the lower prices may well increase the
export trade, and bring money in. But this increase in
<i>stocks</i> of articles of <i>export</i> is very different from total <i>trade</i>
within the country; and lower prices in articles of export
are very different from a generally lower price-level.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<p>Will expanding trade in a country increase credit? I
come here to one of the striking features of Fisher's doctrine&mdash;a
feature in which I think he is fundamentally true
to the quantity theory. He finds no way in which expanding
trade can directly increase credit. Expanding trade
can increase credit, (a) only by changing the habits of the
people, so as to alter the ratio, M to M&acute;, or (b) by reducing
the price-level, and so bringing in money from abroad,
whence, as M is now increased, M&acute; rises proportionately.
"An increase in the volume of trade in any one country,
say the United States, ultimately increases the money in
circulation (M). In no other way could there be avoided
a depression in the price-level in the United States as compared
with foreign countries. [He should say, from the
standpoint of his theory, that increasing trade will cause a
fall in the price-level, and so bring in more money.] <i>The
increase in M brings about a proportionate increase in M&acute;.</i><a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
Besides this effect, the increase in trade undoubtedly has
some effect in modifying the habits of the community with
regard to the <i>proportion</i> of check and cash transactions,
and so tends somewhat to increase M&acute; relatively to M; as
a country grows more commercial the need for the use of
checks is more strikingly felt."<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> In a footnote to this
paragraph, he defines the issue still more sharply. "This
is very far from asserting as Laughlin does that 'The limit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
to the increase in legitimate credit operations is always
expansible with the increase in the actual movement of
goods'; see <i>Principles of Money</i>,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> New York (Scribner),
1903, p. 82. We have seen, in Chapter IV, that deposit
currency is proportional to the amount of money; a change
in trade may indirectly, <i>i. e.</i>, by changing the <i>habits</i> of the
community, influence the proportion, but, except for
transition periods, it cannot influence it directly."<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<p>My own explanation of the causal sequence whereby expanding
trade brings money into a country would be radically
different from that given by Fisher in the first quotation.
I should expect, first, that rising <i>prices</i> would
encourage rising trade; I should then expect the rising
volume of trade, with higher prices, to lead borrowers to
need, and secure, larger loans from the banks, with, as
loans and deposits rise in proportion to reserves, some slight
increase in "money-rates," just enough to draw to the
country the extra gold which bankers felt desirable to add
to their reserves. I should expect the causal sequence to
be the exact reverse of that which Fisher indicates. With
falling prices, or waning volume of trade&mdash;which would
usually come together,<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>&mdash;I should expect loans to be reduced,
deposits to be reduced, money-rates to fall, and
gold then to leave the country again. I should expect
this sort of thing to happen normally, and not infrequently,
and I should expect gold to come in and go out many times
in the course of a business cycle. This would seem to be
the sort of explanation which our modern theory of <i>elastic</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
bank-credit would give in connection with this problem.
I shall not here go into details with the theory of elastic
bank-credit. The theory has been too well established in the
debates between the "Currency School" and the "Banking
School"<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> in regard to bank-notes to need elaboration
and defence here, and the essential identity of deposits and
elastic bank-notes from this angle is one of the commonplaces
of the literature of banking. What I am here concerned
with is the highly significant fact that Fisher's
"normal" theory finds no place for this highly important
phenomenon. The quantity theory has no explanation
of elasticity to give. On the basis of the quantity theory,
and for all that the quantity theory can say, the Currency
School was right! Fisher offers us, virtually, a "currency
theory" of deposits. "Suppose, as has actually been the
case in recent years, that the ratio of M&acute; to M increases in
the United States. If the magnitudes in the equations of
exchange in other countries with which the United States is
connected by trade are constant, the ultimate effect on M
is to make it less than what it would otherwise have been,
by increasing the exports of gold from the United States or
reducing the imports. In no other way can the price-level
of the United States be prevented from rising above that
of other nations in which we have assumed this level and
the other magnitudes in the equation of exchange to be
quiescent." (P. 162.) If "bank-notes" be substituted for
"M&acute;", in this quotation, we have here a perfect statement
of the position of the "Currency School" in that great debate.
Must this old issue be fought all over again? And
yet, I defy any consistent quantity theorist to find any flaw
in Fisher's argument on this point. There is no place for a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
theory of elastic bank-credit within the confines of the
quantity theory. Fisher's recognition of this seems full
and complete. He relegates all mention of elastic bank-credit
to "transitions." The footnote quoted above, in
which Laughlin's (somewhat extreme) doctrine based on
the theory of elasticity is stated, denies categorically that
there is any validity in it, except for transition periods.
There is nowhere in the book any explanation of the theory
of elasticity.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> The references to it are few and grudging,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
and <i>always</i> in connection with the notion of transitions.
The most important statement regarding elasticity (less
than a page long) is on page 161, where again transitional
influences are under discussion. What is a theory of money
worth which can offer no explanation of so fundamental,
important, and notorious a feature of modern money and
banking?</p>

<p>There is a further, related, feature of banking for which
the quantity theory can find no explanation. Among the
items in a bank's balance sheet, the quantity theorist
seizes upon reserves on the assets side, and deposits on the
liability side, and builds his theory on the supposed close
relation between them. We have seen that this close relation
does not, in fact, exist. The range of variation is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>enormous.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> But there is one close relation in the balance
sheet of the bank concerning which the quantity theory is
silent, and that is the relation between deposits and <i>loans</i>.
For individual banks and for banks in the aggregate, for
long run periods and for short run periods, for reasons that
are clear and inevitable, these two magnitudes (or for
banks of issue on the Continent of Europe, <i>notes</i> and loans),
vary closely together. The relationship between them is
the only relationship which does stand out as clearly beyond
dispute, among all the items in the banking balance sheet.
No assumptions of a "static state" are needed for its
demonstration! The relation varies, of course. As banks
increase or reduce their capital, as their reserve-percentages
rise or fall, as they increase or decrease their holdings of
bonds, we find reasons which alter the proportion between
deposits and loans. But, despite this, the variation, as
shown by figures for the United States, is slight. Assume,
for example, a statement showing "loans and discounts"
of $1,000,000, deposits, $1,000,000, cash reserve, $200,000.
Reserves are then 20% of deposits, and loans are 100% of
deposits. If reserves be increased by $100,000 and loans
and discounts reduced, to compensate, by $100,000, we
have a 50% variation in the ratio of reserves to deposits,
with only a 10% variation in the ratio of loans and discounts
to deposits. Since cash reserve is much the smaller
item, almost always, the same absolute variation in it
will affect it, in percentage, vastly more than it will affect
loans and discounts. It is strange that a theory should
seize on this highly variable ratio of reserves to deposits,
and ignore the much more constant ratio<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> of loans and
discounts to deposits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>That this close relation between deposits and loans should
obtain follows naturally from the theory of elastic bank-credit.
The two are built up together. When there are
expanding business and rising prices, men borrow more
from the banks; as they borrow, they receive deposit
credits; the individual who receives the deposit credit may
check against it, but it is redeposited by another man, and
so, while the deposits of one bank need not grow out of its
loans, still, for banks in general, deposits are large because
loans are large. For a given bank, the relation holds
closely, because the bank lends, in general, to active business
men, who will have income as well as outgo, and whose
income will, on the average, at least balance their outgo.
Thus, <i>through loans</i>, deposits are linked with volume of
trade and prices. Trade and deposits wax and wane together.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
On the other hand, in the absence of rising prices
and increasing trade, reserves may increase greatly without
forcing an increase in deposits. Loans cannot increase
without an increase in deposits. The linkage between
deposits and trade is definite, causal, positive, statistically
demonstrable. The linkage between reserves and deposits
is, at most, negative&mdash;if reserves get too low, deposits and
loans may be checked in their expansion. But this&mdash;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
the extent that it is true, which we leave, for detailed analysis,
for Part III&mdash;gives a very much looser relation indeed
than the direct relation between loans and deposits.</p>

<p>The quantity theory has offered no explanation of this
relation between loans and deposits. What explanation
could a theory offer, which rests in the notion that volume
of trade on the one hand, and volume of money and bank-credit
on the other hand, are independent magnitudes?<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> I
do not mean that quantity <i>theorists</i> are silent regarding the
relation of loans and deposits. I mean that they do not
attempt, in any discussion I have found, to apply the quantity
<i>theory</i> to the explanation of that relation. What shall
we say of a theory which, ignoring these easily proved,
easily explained, and vital facts regarding bank-credit,
offers as its sole explanation of volume of bank-credit a
theory so untenable as that of a fixed ratio between volume
of bank-credit and volume of money <i>in circulation</i>, with
causation running from money to deposits?</p>

<p>Professor Fisher says little about bills of exchange. Here,
surely, we have a credit instrument which grows directly
out of trade, in general, and whose volume expands and
contracts with trade. When banks discount bills of exchange,
and issue notes, or grant deposit credits, against
such discounted bills, the connection of bank-credit and
volume of trade is obvious. The same thing holds largely,
however, when promissory notes are discounted. Such
notes are usually given by those who plan to use the credits
granted in commercial or speculative transactions. The
bill of exchange differs from the promissory note in practice,
however, in that it itself is often a medium of exchange,
without going into the bank's portfolio. "The
bill of exchange, therefore, before it gets to the bank <i>usually</i><a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
performs a series of monetary transfers, for the small<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
dealer naturally prefers to pass on the bill, if possible, in
making a payment, instead of handing it over to his bank,
which would either deduct a certain percentage in the way
of discount, or else accept the bill at its face value, crediting
the customer with the amount on the date of maturity,
while business men (other than bankers) are in the habit of
taking bills of exchange as they would cash."<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> This quotation
describes conditions in Germany. The same authorities
(p. 176) give figures showing a rapid development
in the volume of bills of exchange, rising from about 13
billions of marks in 1872 to about 31 billions in 1907. These
figures show that bills of exchange are a big factor in German
business life,&mdash;a conclusion that is strengthened when they
are compared with the figures for giro-transfers on pp. 188-189
of the same article, or with the figures for note issue
on p. 209.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> In the United States, of course, the use of bills
of exchange has become comparatively unimportant in
domestic commerce,<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> though there is a movement to revive
them, since the new Federal Reserve system has come in.
Their chief importance is in connection with foreign trade.
Is it possible that Professor Fisher's reason for wishing to
minimize foreign trade<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> is the unconscious desire to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
rid of the annoying bills of exchange, which so obviously
tend to make bank-credit and volume of trade interdependent,
and which further spoil the quantity theory by
serving as a flexible substitute for both money and deposits?</p>

<p>I regret the necessity for this elementary exposition of
familiar things. But Fisher's theory has no place for these
familiar things&mdash;and Fisher has merely made very explicit
the logic of the quantity theory!</p>

<p>As applied to modern conditions, the quantity theory
is obliged to assert&mdash;and Fisher does assert:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(a) that there is a causal dependence of bank-credit on
money, and "normally" a fixed ratio between them;</p>

<p>(b) that velocity of circulation of money and credit instruments
are independent of quantity of money and
credit instruments;</p>

<p>(c) that, in general, money and volume of credit (taken
together), velocities, and trade, are independent magnitudes,
each governed by separate laws, though Fisher
concedes <i>some</i> reaction of trade on velocities;</p>

<p>(d) in particular, that volume of money and credit has
no influence on trade, and that trade has no direct influence
on volume of credit.</p>

<p>All these doctrines are necessary if the contention that
an increase of money will proportionately raise prices is to
be maintained, or if it is to be maintained that a decrease
in trade will proportionately raise prices. I have analyzed
each of these contentions, and I find justification for none
of them.</p></div>

<p>Not yet, however, have we reached the least tenable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>aspect of the quantity theory. There remains the contention
that prices are passive, that a change, <i>originating</i> in
prices, and involving a change in the average price, or the
general price-level, cannot maintain itself&mdash;that P is a passive
function of the other five magnitudes of the equation
of exchange. To this central fortress of the quantity theory
we shall devote the next chapter.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h3>THE QUANTITY THEORY: THE "PASSIVENESS OF
PRICES"</h3>


<p>Is the price-level passive? Is it true that while change
may occur from causes outside the equation of exchange in
volume of money, volume of trade, and velocities of circulation,
a change in the price-level from causes outside the
equation is impossible? Must the average of prices be a
passive function of M, the V's, M&acute; and T? Such is the
general contention of the quantity theory, and such, very
explicitly, is Fisher's contention. The price-level is always
effect, and never cause (with slight modifications of the
doctrine for transition periods) in its relations to the other
magnitudes in the equation of exchange.</p>

<p>Now in one sense, it is my own contention that the price-<i>level</i>
can never be a <i>cause</i> of anything. The price-level is
an <i>average</i>. Averages may be <i>indicia</i> of causation, but
they are not themselves causes. They are not, in reality,
anything <i>at all</i>. Causation is a matter which pertains to
the particulars of which the average is made. But this is
not the doctrine of the quantity theory. The quantity
theory does, in certain connections, assign causal influence
to the level of prices, particularly in the theory of foreign
exchange, where the explanation of international gold
movements rests on the doctrine that a price-level in one
country, higher than the price-level of another country,
drives money away.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> It will be seen, in a moment, that
Fisher relies on this principle to prove that the price-level<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
of a country cannot rise without an increase of money&mdash;if it
did so rise, it would drive out the money, and so be forced
down again. The point at issue may be stated in terms of
particular prices. The quantity theory is that, while particular
prices may rise from causes affecting them, as compared
with other prices, without a change in money, velocities,
etc., still there cannot be a rise in the general average,
because other prices will be obliged to go down to compensate.
The issue is as to the possibility of a rise in particular
prices, uncompensated by a corresponding fall in
other particular prices, without a <i>prior</i> increase in money,
or velocities, or decrease in trade. I take up the issue in
this form. I shall maintain that particular prices can, and
do, rise, without a <i>prior</i> increase in money or bank-deposits,
or change in the volume of trade, or in velocity of money
or deposits and also without compensating fall in other
particular prices. Putting it in terms of Fisher's equation,
I shall maintain, as against Fisher, that P can rise through
the direct action of factors <i>outside</i> the equation of exchange,
that as a <i>consequence of such rise</i> the other factors readjust
themselves, and that a new equilibrium is reached which,
in the absence of new disturbances from causes outside the
equation, tends to be as permanent and stable as the old
equilibrium was.</p>

<p>In the argument which follows, I shall respect thoroughly
the distinction between "normal" and "transitional"
effects. I do not think that this distinction is properly
drawn by Fisher. In my discussion of the relation between
the volume of bank-credit and the volume of trade,
and in other connections, I have shown that Fisher leaves
out of his normal theory most of the concrete factors which
do affect both the concrete magnitudes, and the long run
<i>averages</i>, of the factors in his own equation. But for the
present, I shall meet him on his own ground, give his dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>tinctions
their fullest weight, and carry my argument
through the "transition" to a point where no further
change among the factors in the equation can be expected
as a consequence of the initial change assumed.</p>

<p>Fisher's argument to show the passiveness of prices takes
the form of a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. "To show the untenability
of such an idea let us grant for the sake of argument
that&mdash;in some other way than as effect of changes in
M, M&acute;, V, V&acute;, and the Q's&mdash;the prices in (say) the United
States are changed to (say) double the original level, and
let us see what effect this will produce on the other magnitudes
in the equation."<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Then, if the equation of exchange
is to be maintained, either M or M&acute; or their velocities must
be increased, or trade must be reduced. But he holds that
none of these is possible. (1) Money will be reduced. High
prices drive money away to other countries. Nor can
gold come in via the mints. "No one will take bullion
to the mints when he thereby loses half its value."<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a>
On the contrary, men will melt down coin. Nor will high
prices stimulate mining. Rather, by raising the expenses
of mining, they will discourage mining. (2) Bank-deposits
cannot increase. Bank-deposits depend on the amount
of money, and as that is reduced, they must be reduced, to
keep their normal ratio to the volume of money. (3) The
appeal to velocities is no more satisfactory. These have
been already adjusted to individual convenience.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> (4) Nor
can trade be decreased. Since the average person will not
only pay, but also receive, high prices, there is no reason
why he should reduce his purchases. "<i>The price-level is
normally the one absolutely passive element in the equation of
exchange.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a></p>

<p>"But though it is a fallacy to think that the price-level<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
in one community can, in the long run, affect the money in
<i>that</i> community, it is true that the price-level in one community
may affect the money in <i>another</i> community. This
proposition has been repeatedly made use of in our discussion,
and should be clearly distinguished from the fallacy
above mentioned. The price-level in an outside community
is an influence outside the equation of exchange of
that community, and operates by affecting its money in
circulation and not by directly affecting its price-level.
<i>The price-level outside New York City, for instance, affects
the price-level in New York City only</i> via <i>changes in the money
in New York City</i>."<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>...</p>

<p>"Were it not for the fanatical refusal of some economists
to admit that the price-level is in ultimate analysis effect
and not cause, we should not be at so great pains to prove
it beyond cavil." To explain this "fanatical refusal,"
Fisher alludes to the "fallacious idea" that the equation
of exchange cannot determine the price-level, because the
price-level has already been determined by other causes,
usually alluded to as "supply and demand." He urges,
however, that supply and demand, cost of production, etc.,
relate, not to the price-level, but only to particular prices:
that the price-level is a factor prior to, and independent of,
the particular prices, and is presupposed by theories like
supply and demand, cost of production, etc.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>

<p>The <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, at first blush, looks impressive.
One obvious criticism suggests itself, however, and it will
be found to give a clue to a much more fundamental criticism:
is it reasonable to assume a doubling of <i>all</i> prices?
Above all, must the assumption involve the doubling of the
price of gold bullion? Part of the argument to show that
gold bullion would not be minted rests on that assumption.
But, more fundamental, for such an all round doubling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
prices, no <i>cause</i> could be assigned. Of course the hypothesis
of an increase in prices without any cause is absurd,
and Fisher easily disposes of it. But suppose we assign
some <i>concrete causes</i>, outside the equation of exchange,
which might affect prices, and see how the thing works
then!</p>

<p>Fisher states on p. 95 that "other elements in the equation
of exchange than money and commodities<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> cannot be
transported from one place to another." And in the passage
quoted above he maintains that price-levels in one
country can influence price-levels in another country, or
even price-levels in one city can influence price-levels in
another city, only <i>via</i> changes in money, in the second
country or city. But other elements in the equation are
<i>directly</i> transferable, in fact. <i>Deposits</i>, <i>e. g.</i>, in London,
to the credit of New York bankers, may be transferred to
Paris, directly, by <i>cable</i> or by <i>letter</i>, and <i>prices</i> are constantly
being directly passed from one country or market
to another by the same media. Let us suppose a strong
case, to put our principle in relief. Assume an island, which
produces a staple widely used, whose chief centre of production
is outside the island. Assume that this staple, an
agricultural product, rises greatly in price, owing to a
blight, which promises to be permanent, in the main producing
region. The blight does not affect the island, however.
Let this product be the main product of our island,
which we shall assume to be small. Let the island have
communication with the outside world by boat only once
in three months. Let it be, however, in constant communication
by cable. Word comes by cable of the rise in
the price in the staple. The staple at once rises in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
island. No new money has come in to cause it. Will
this be a rise in the price-level? Will there be compensating
reductions in the prices of other things to leave the
price-level unchanged? What prices can fall? Not the
prices of goods that have been imported to the island,
surely. They will rather tend to rise, because everybody
on the island will feel richer than before, and will be disposed
to buy more freely. Meanwhile, merchants and
bankers on the island will be more ready to extend credit
than before, so that they will be able to buy more freely.
What else can fall? Not the prices of the land! Rather,
the land will rise in price greatly, because the increased
price of the staple, expected to be permanent, will promise
bigger rents, and the price of the land, being a <i>capitalization</i>
of the annual rental, will rise very much more than
anything else&mdash;it will rise to the extent of the capitalized
price of the increase in the rents. Wages, likewise, will
rise, since the price of the product of labor has risen. And
the capital instruments in use in producing the staple will
also rise, though not so much as land and wages, inasmuch
as they can be brought in from outside at the end of three
months. What is there that can fall&mdash;except, perhaps,
such goods as are exclusively designed for the construction
of poorhouses! A significant particular price rises&mdash;that
is the first step; then, from causes familiar to all students
of economics, other related prices rise; there is a general
<i>sympathetic</i> rise in prices, the <i>price-level</i> has risen independently,
from causes <i>outside the equation of exchange</i>. But
now, can this rise sustain itself? Well, what can bring it
down? When the ship comes, at the end of three months,
it will bring in additional supplies of the articles of import,
and they will go down to their old level. Will they go any
lower than the old level? What is there to cause them
to do so? The outside price-level should be higher now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
rather than lower, since the <i>stock</i> of the staple in question
is reduced, and nothing else increased to compensate. Nor
can any reason be assigned why other prices on the island:
the staple in question, lands, wages, etc., should fall at all
from the level they reached when the news first came.</p>

<p>Incidentally, our ship may also bring in more gold. The
bankers, finding their deposits expanding, may feel it well
to cable orders for more gold to increase their reserves,
especially as they have been subject to somewhat unusual
calls for cash for hand to hand circulation&mdash;though this
last need they might well have been meeting by expanding
their note issue.</p>

<p>Is there anything else to be said? Is not the new equilibrium
stable? And is not the causal sequence precisely
the reverse of that assigned by the quantity theory? <i>First</i>.
a rise in prices; <i>second</i>, an expansion of credit, book-credit,
notes and deposits; <i>third</i>, money comes in. If anyone is
particularly anxious about the equation of exchange in this
process, he may add to my expansion of credit an increase
in velocities to keep it straight!</p>

<p>I may add that I see nothing in the "transition" I have
described to cause trade to be reduced. Rather, I should
expect the rising prices to make trade more active&mdash;or
better, I should expect the rising <i>values</i> of goods, etc., of
which rising prices are the symptom, to make trade more
active, particularly as there would be an increase in speculation
to bring about readjustments, and to "discount" the
prosperity. Nor can I find any reason why trade should be
reduced below the old level in the new normal equilibrium.
It would make no difference, however, if trade were reduced
either transitionally or normally, since the point at issue is
the possibility of a rise in prices originating from causes outside
the equation of exchange, and compelling a readjustment
of a permanent character in the other factors of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
equation. The quantity theorist is at liberty to make this
readjustment in any way he pleases. My point is made if
he has to make the readjustment, and if the price-level
stays up!</p>

<p>I have put my illustration in an extreme form to throw
the whole thing in relief, and to make the demonstration
free from a host of complexities. But is not the causal
process essentially the same if we substitute, say, the
Southern States for our island, and cotton for our staple?
So long as the telegraph bringing news of the ruin of cotton
production in India and Egypt, with the higher price of
cotton, can come in ahead of the money that the quantity
theorist might imagine rushing in a race with it on the
train to be offered for the cotton, my point is made. In
point of fact, there would be a general rise in prices and
wages in the South, which, leading to an expansion of credit,
would only gradually and in no definite ratio lead to an
increase in money drawn from outside. Buyers outside
would pay, not with money, but with checks drawn on
New York, and Southern bankers would use their discretion
as to how much actual cash they would bring in.
With the elastic note issue of our Federal Reserve system,
I see no reason to anticipate that money would be drawn
to the South in an amount proportionate to the increase
in prices. Even if it were, the causation would not run
from money to prices, and that is the point at issue. If
<i>rising</i> prices can cause increasing money, the whole quantity
theory is upset, whatever the proportions involved.</p>

<p>It will be noted that my illustration might be put partly
in the form of the supply and demand argument. Increasing
demand for cotton in the South leads to higher price of
cotton; higher price of cotton makes cotton-growers richer,
and enables them to increase their demand for imported
goods, for land, and for labor. Supply and demand comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
into conflict with the quantity theory, and does not suffer
in the conflict! Supply and demand determine particular
prices, and particular prices determine the price-level!</p>

<p>Now I wish to generalize this point. I shall show that
the quantity theory conflicts with most of our doctrines of
prices, as worked out in our systems of economics. I
shall show that, in important cases, the quantity theory
conflicts with the law of supply and demand, with the doctrine
of cost of production, with the capitalization theory,
and with the doctrine of imputation as worked out by the
Austrians, whereby the prices of labor, land, and other
agents of production rise or fall with the prices of the consumption
goods which they produce. I shall show the
conflict in important cases, and shall show also, in those
cases, that it is not the quantity theory which can be sustained.</p>

<p>The general form of the conflict may be stated for all
these theories. They are theories of the <i>relations</i> of particular
prices, concerned with showing that individual
prices are so related that they tend to <i>vary together</i>. A
rise in one price, according to these theories, tends to bring
about <i>rises</i> in others, and <i>vice versa</i>. The quantity theory,
on the other hand, asserts a relation among individual
prices such that a rise in one tends to bring about a <i>fall</i> in
others&mdash;it requires a <i>compensatory</i> fall at one point, if there
has been a rise somewhere else.</p>

<p>Let us take some cases. I shall take, first, the conflict
between the quantity theory and the capitalization theory,
as I can use the illustration just given in connection with
it. I have, in a preceding chapter, given a statement of
the capitalization theory. It is a theory concerned with
the prices of long-time goods and income-bearers, as lands,
houses, capital goods of various sorts that give forth their
services through a series of years, stocks, bonds, etc. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
prices of things of this sort, according to the capitalization<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
theory, depend on two factors: one, the money income
expected from the income-bearer, the other, the prevailing
rate of interest. This money income, except in the case
of bonds, commonly depends on the prices of the products
of the income-bearer, or (in the case of stocks) of the
products of the concrete capital-goods to which the income-bearer
gives title. If we may follow the Austrian division
of goods into higher and lower "orders," or "ranks," we
may say that the prices of the goods of higher ranks are the
capitalizations of the prices of the goods of lower ranks
specifically produced by them. Thus, concretely, if the
price of wheat rises, we may expect the prices of land
to rise, if the rate of interest remains the same. If the
price of steel rises, we may expect the stocks of the U. S.
Steel corporation to rise, also. If the prices of smokeless
powder, and other war munitions soar, we may expect
the prices of the stocks of the corporations involved
to do precisely what they have done in the recent course
of the stock market. All this, on the assumption that the
rate of interest does not change, and that the risk factor
remains constant. If these factors vary, the results will
not present the mathematical exactitude that the formula
calls for, but the general tendency will remain the same.
On the other hand, if the incomes remain unchanged, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the rate of interest rises, then we may expect the capitalized
prices to fall, and if the rate of interest falls, we may expect
the capitalized prices to rise. From the standpoint of the
present discussion, I suppose it might be fairest and best
to state the capitalization theory on this point as Fisher
himself states it. In his <i>Elementary Principles of Economics</i>
(ed. 1912) after giving a table showing in figures the difference
made in different capital prices by different rates of
interest (p. 125) he states (126): "If the value of the benefits
derivable from these various articles continues in each
case uniform, but the rate of interest is suddenly cut
down from 5% to 2&frac12;%, there will result a general increase
in the capital values, but a very different increase
for the different articles. The more enduring ones will
be affected the most." And in his book, <i>The Rate of Interest</i>:
"The orchard whose yield of apples should increase
from $1,000 worth to $2,000 worth would itself correspondingly
increase in value from, say, $20,000 to something
like $40,000 and the ratio of the income to the capital
value, would remain about as before, namely, 5%."
(P. 15.) On the next page, he generalizes his notion: "One
cannot escape this conclusion (as has sometimes been attempted)
by supposing the increasing productivity to be
universal. It has been asserted, in substance, that though
an increase in the productivity of one orchard would not
affect the total productivity of capital, and hence would not
appreciably affect the rate of interest, yet, if the productivity
of all the capital in the world could be doubled, the
rate of interest would be doubled. It is true that doubling
the productivity of the world's capital would not be entirely
without effect upon the rate of interest; but this
effect would not be in the simple direct ratio supposed.
Indeed, an increase of the productivity of capital would
probably result in a decrease, instead of an increase, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
rate of interest. <i>To double the productivity of capital might
more than double the value of the capital.</i>" (<i>Rate of Interest</i>,
p. 16.)<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Fisher reiterates this doctrine in his reply to
Seager, in the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Sept. 1913, pp.
614-615.</p>

<p>Now my concern here is not with the points at issue as
between Fisher and Seager: the "impatience" vs. the
"productivity" theories of interest. For the present, I
shall accept Fisher's doctrine on that point as true.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> I am
here interested in Fisher's doctrine that a doubling of the
general productivity of capital would double, or more than
double, the prices of capital instruments, including land.
How is such a general rise in prices possible, if the quantity
theory be true? Is not this a rise in general prices from
causes outside the equation of exchange? That Fisher
means the <i>money-prices</i> of capital goods when he speaks
of capital-values is perfectly clear. In the second quotation,
he speaks of "capital-value of $40,000", and in general,
his definition of value runs in terms of <i>price</i> (<i>e. g.,
Purchasing Power of Money,</i> pp. 3-4, and <i>Elementary Principles</i>,
p. 17). Fisher has no absolute value concept in his
system. We have in the passages cited two doctrines,
both of which contradict the quantity theory: (1) that a
reduction in the rate of interest will raise capital-prices
(which are the largest factor by far in the price-level), and
(2) that an increase in the product of capital goods means,
not only more money paid for the products, but also more
money paid for the production-goods. Incidentally, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
general imputation theory would call for more money paid
to laborers as well. How can all this be, on the quantity
theory? And what can the poor equation of exchange do
in such a case, if money does not increase, if bank-credit is
limited by money, if velocities of circulation are fixed by
individual habits and convenience, if trade <i>increases</i> as a
consequence of the increased number of goods produced,
and if prices rise? It will not help much to assume that
the productivity of gold mines is doubled also. The quantity
of money does not depend very much on the annual
production of gold. Besides, money need not, from the
standpoint of the quantity theory, be made of gold. It
might be irredeemable Greenbacks, fixed in quantity by
law, or even dodo-bones! Would not the capitalization
theory apply in the Greenback Period? I shall not try to
solve the riddle. I am not responsible for it!</p>

<p>The conflict between the capitalization theory and the
quantity theory may be more simply stated. Assume that
the prices of consumers' goods and services rise, quantity
of money and volume of exchanges remaining unchanged.
On the quantity theory, other prices, the prices of producers'
goods and services, lands, and securities, would
have to come down enough to compensate, in order that the
price-level might remain unchanged. For the capitalization
theory, however, the prices of lands, securities, and
long time capital goods in general would have to rise, since
the incomes on which they are based have risen. Wages
of labor engaged in making consumers' goods would also
have to rise, on the general imputation theory.</p>

<p>The quantity theory conflicts with the capitalization
theory. The quantity theory as presented by Fisher conflicts
with the capitalization theory as presented by Fisher.
Which theory is true? Would prices rise thus, or would
they be held down in some way by the limitations on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
quantity of money? I hold that I have already proved,
in the reasoning given in connection with my hypothetical
island, and in the case of the South with its cotton, that
the capitalization theory tendency would prevail. The
prices of products rise, and then the prices of the labor,
land, and other capital goods which have produced them,
rise, the rise in the prices of the capital goods behaving in
accordance with the laws of the capitalization theory, and
all of the rises after the initial rise in products being in
accordance with the imputation theory of the Austrians.</p>

<p>This conflict suggests an interesting point. Various
elements in our economic theory, added from time to time
by different writers, have necessarily come from different
philosophical and sociological view-points, and have behind
them different philosophical, psychological, and sociological
assumptions. The quantity theory, developing, as shown in
the chapter on "Supply and Demand and the Value of
Money," largely in isolation from the general body of economic
theory, has a background of psychological and sociological
assumptions quite different from that of many other
doctrines. In the chapter on "Dodo-Bones," I stated these
assumptions. The quantity theory rests in a psychology
of blind habit. It assumes a rigidity in the social system such
that it might be likened to a machine, with a hopper into
which money is poured, which grinds out prices at the other
end. I set this in contrast with the psychological assumptions
underlying the commodity theory of money. That
theory rests on the "banker's psychology." It assumes a
highly reflective and calculating attitude on the part of economic
men, with the disposition to look behind appearances
for the security, to test things out, to get to bedrock in business
affairs. Now the capitalization theory likewise assumes
this banker's psychology. In its refinements, as represented
by the mathematical formul&aelig; in the appendices of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
Fisher's <i>Rate of Interest</i>, it assumes a degree of precision in
business calculation which few experts in bond departments
apply, and which the highly fluid and alert dealers in Wall
Street certainly have not time for, even if they had that
degree of mathematical knowledge! In practice, it need
not be said, particularly in the case of the prices of lands,
the capitalization theory finds its predictions very imperfectly
realized! But the two theories, resting in such
divergent psychological assumptions, may be expected, <i>a
priori</i>, to conflict. That they do conflict is not remarkable.</p>

<p>I shall show a similar conflict between the quantity theory
and the law of costs. In general, the quantity theorist
thinks that he has reconciled his theory with cost theory
by pointing out that reduced costs manifest themselves
in increasing production, which means increasing trade,
which should, on the quantity theory, mean lower prices.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
I need not, for my purposes, analyze this doctrine in detail,
though I am disposed to consider it an accident that the
two theories converge at this point. For the present, I
shall analyze a case where reducing costs actually come
as a consequence of the <i>reduction</i> in the volume of trade,
and inquire whether such a case will lead, as the cost theory
would assert, to lowered general prices, or, as the quantity
theory would assert, to <i>higher</i> general prices. The case is
that where by improved methods of handling goods, it is
possible to dispense with middlemen. Concretely, assume
that retailers of milk get in direct touch with dairymen, so
that middlemen are eliminated, and that as a consequence
the price of milk is reduced two cents a quart. What of
the general price-level? T (trade) is reduced. There are
less exchanges. Volume of trade does not mean volume of
goods <i>produced</i>, but volume of <i>exchanges</i>. With a reduced
trade, the quantity theory must assert that prices of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>modities
other than milk must, on the average, rise, not
merely enough to compensate for the fall in milk, but more
than that, enough to compensate for the reduced trade as
well. But how can the other prices rise? Well, a point
comes up obviously: the buyers of milk save two cents a
quart. They can spend it for something else. This will
raise the prices of other things. But, on the other hand,
the middlemen now have less to spend. They have <i>exactly
as much less</i> as the others have <i>more</i>, the extra money
that milk buyers have being, in fact, the money that the
middlemen would otherwise have had. The one offsets
the other. There is, then, no reason for the average of
other prices to rise. Suppose we carry the process one step
further. After a while, the middleman will find other
work to do. Then they will have incomes again to spend.
But in going to work again, they will be engaged in production,
and so will, in general, be increasing the volume of
trade. The quantity theorist could not expect a rise in
prices from this!</p>

<p>And here we are given a clue to a fundamental confusion
in the quantity theory, a confusion which, accepted by the
reader, gives the quantity theory much of its plausibility.
I refer to the confusion between <i>volume of money</i>, and
volume of <i>money-income</i>.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> The two need not be the same.
The two generally are not the same. In the case I have
described, the one has changed without a change in the
other. Now if one wishes to view the process of price-causation
from the standpoint of money offered for goods,&mdash;an
essentially superficial,<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> but frequently useful, view<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>-point&mdash;it
is clearly money-<i>income</i>, rather than mere quantity
of money in the country that is important. Into the
determination of volume of money-income, however, come
factors of a high degree of complexity, among them, prices
for which there is no possible place within the confines of
so simple and mechanical a doctrine as the quantity theory.</p>

<p>In passing, I notice a point to which I called attention
in discussing Fisher's factors in the equation of exchange.
I refer to his definition of velocity of circulation as the
average of "person-turnovers" of money.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> In the illustration
given, there is no reason to suppose that this average
is changed. The middlemen simply drop out of the
average. They have no money to turn over! But velocity
of circulation, defined as "coin-transfer," (<i>cf.</i> <i>supra</i>,
p. 204) has clearly changed. The course of money has been
short-circuited. It goes through fewer hands in the course
of a given period. This last concept of velocity of circulation
is clearly the one that must be used, if the equation
of exchange is to be kept straight. But this fact should
make it clear that velocity of circulation, instead of being
the inflexible thing that Fisher has described, resting in
individual habits and practices, a true causal factor in the
price making process, is really a highly flexible thing, in
large degree a passive function of trade and prices.</p>

<p>With this distinction between volume of money and
volume of money-income<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> clearly held, we are prepared to
go further in our attack on the quantity theory, granting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the quantity theorist all his most rigorous assumptions,
and still demonstrating that prices can vary independently,
without prior change in quantity of money, volume of
trade, or velocity of money. Let us assume the extreme
case of the quantity theory: a closed market; no credit; no
barter; a fixed supply of money; a fixed volume of trade;
a fixed set of habits affecting velocity, namely, that everyone
spends, in the course of the month, all that he has accumulated
by the first of the month. The quantity theorist
could not ask a more iron-clad set of assumptions than this!
If the quantity theory is not valid here, if the price-level is
not absolutely fixed, helpless to change, with these assumptions,
then the quantity theory, even as a minor tendency,
must be surrendered, and the quantity theorist must admit
that the whole line of thought has been fallacious. But is
the price-level passive? Suppose we assume a combination
of employers of maid-servants, which forces down the
wages of maid-servants from $20 to $10 per month. Assume
further that there is no alternative employment for
the maid-servants, so that they all remain at work.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> So
far, we have made a change in <i>one</i> price, the price of domestic
service. What of the general average of prices, the
price-<i>level</i>? Well, so far, the price-level is down. If
nothing else takes place, we have reduced the price-level
by reducing one price. What else can take place? Two
things: (1) the masters now have $10 per month each more
to spend for other things than before. That tends to raise
prices in their other channels of expenditure. (2) The maid-servants
now have $10 each less to spend,&mdash;the same ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
dollars! That lessens prices in the lines of their expenditure.
These last two changes exactly neutralize one another.
The first change, in the price of domestic service,
remains unneutralized. The general price-level is, then,
lowered&mdash;by a cause acting from outside the equation of
exchange, directly on prices. The first change comes in
one price. In the final adjustment, that change remains
unneutralized. How is this possible? Is the equation of
exchange still valid? As a mathematical formula, yes.
As expressing a causal theory, in which prices are effect,
and money, trade, and velocity causes, no. The equation
is kept straight by a reduction in velocity. <i>Because</i> the
wages of maid-servants are reduced, <i>less</i> money goes through
their <i>hands</i>; $10 per month per maid are short-circuited.
But the <i>cause</i> is with the <i>prices</i>. The price-level, even
under these absolutely rigorous assumptions, is not passive.</p>

<p>In general, I conclude that the price-level, under the
laws governing particular prices, supply and demand, cost of
production, the capitalization theory, the imputation
theory, etc., can vary of its own initiative, independently
of prior changes in the quantity of money, or of volume of
trade, or other factors that the quantity theory stresses;
and that these changes in the price-level (or in the particular
prices which govern the price-level) can maintain
themselves, and compel a readjustment in trade, credit,
money and velocities, to correspond. This conclusion
strikes at the very heart of the quantity theory, and, if
valid, leaves the quantity theory disproved. More fundamentally,
I should put it, prices can change because of
changes in the psychological values of goods. These
values are <i>social</i> values, and are to be explained only by a
social psychology. But for the present it has seemed best
to me, as a means of attracting sympathetic attention from
a wider circle of economists, to make use of the less debated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
doctrines of the science in attacking the quantity theory.
It is not necessary to rest the case on my own special theory
of value. Supply and demand, cost of production, the
capitalization theory, the imputation theory&mdash;the general
laws of the concatenations and interrelations of prices&mdash;are
quite adequate for the confutation of the quantity theory.
They are laws concerned with particular prices, and the
price-level is nothing but the average of particular prices.
Whatever explains, really explains, the particular prices,
also explains the price-level.</p>

<p>Fisher, as we have seen, is not of this opinion. Although
he has defined the price-level as an average of particular
prices<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> he none the less exalts this average into a causal
entity, prior to and master of the particular prices out of
which it is derived, of which it is a mere average.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
average, he maintains, is presupposed in the determination
of all particular prices.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> This seems to me a wholly
untenable position. <i>Ex nihilo nihil fit.</i> There cannot be
<i>more</i> in the average than there is in the particulars from
which it is derived. In point of fact, there is necessarily
vastly less. All the concrete causation is lost. The average,
in itself, is nothing but a <i>statement</i>, a summary of
<i>results</i>. I know nothing more metaphysical in the history
of economic theory than this hypostasis of an
average.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

<p>I reject Fisher's notion that the average of prices is an
independent entity. But I do not consider that the idea
lying behind this untenable doctrine is absurd. Cost of
production, supply and demand, and the other price theories
<i>do</i> presuppose something more fundamental. They do presuppose
<i>money</i>, and the <i>value</i> of money, as has been shown
at length in Part I. The trouble with Fisher's notion comes
in his definition of the value of money in purely relative
terms as the <i>reciprocal of the price-level</i>, and his contention
that the study of the value of money is identical with the
study of price-levels.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Value is not a mere exchange rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>tion.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a>
Rather, every exchange relation involves <i>two</i> values,
the values of the two objects exchanged. These two values
<i>causally</i> determine that exchange relation. In the case of
particular prices, then, we must consider not only the value
of goods, but also the value of money. And the causes determining
the general price-level will therefore include not
alone the values of goods, but also the value of money. In
the foregoing arguments by which I have shown that the
price-level can vary independently of the other factors in the
quantity theory scheme, I have been concerned only with
changes in the values of goods, measured by a constant unit
of value. If the value of money should also be varying, the
concrete results on the price-level would have been different.
On the face of things, there was nothing in the cases I discussed
to require us to suppose that the value of money
would also vary. The argument ran on the assumption of a
fixed value of money. I have shown, in earlier chapters, that
the assumption of a fixed value of money is fundamental
to the laws of supply and demand, cost of production, and
the capitalization theory. In point of fact, this assumption
is rarely true&mdash;never strictly true. For causes which
are in considerable degree independent of the causes governing
the values of goods (as the causes governing their
values are in considerable degree independent of one another),
the value of money varies, now in the same direction
as the values of goods in general, now in an opposite direction.
Further, money itself does not escape the general
laws of concatenation of values. The value of money has
causes which are bound up with the values of other goods.
Thus, when prices are rising and trade expanding, there is
a tendency&mdash;commonly a minor tendency&mdash;for money also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
to rise in value, and so prices do not go quite as high as they
would have gone had money remained constant. This
tendency arises from the fact that there is more work for
money to do in a period of active trade and rising prices.
Gold also tends to rise in value in the arts, with prosperity.
The reverse tendency manifests itself when prices are falling:
money tends, in some measure, to fall in value with
the goods,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> and so prices do not fall as far as they would
fall if money remained constant. But in general, the
causes governing the values of goods, and the causes governing
the value of money, are sufficiently independent to
justify us in studying each separately, in abstraction, on
the assumption that the other is unchanged. Hence,
supply and demand, cost of production, and the other
price theories, which assume a fixed value of money, are
proper tools of thought for the study of the prices of goods.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h3>THE QUANTITY THEORY AND INTERNATIONAL
GOLD MOVEMENTS</h3>


<p>The quantity theory explanation of international gold
movements is as follows: if money comes into a country, it
raises prices. If the price-level of the country is raised
more rapidly than the price-levels of other countries are
rising, then the country becomes a bad place in which to
buy and a good place in which to sell; its exports fall off,
its imports increase, and finally the inflow of money is
checked, and, perhaps, money flows out again. The equilibrium
of the gold supplies of different countries is thus
dependent on the price-levels of the countries involved.
The quantity of gold in a country determines its price-level,
and no more gold can stay in a country, on this theory,
than that amount which keeps its price-level in proper relation
to the price-levels of other countries. It is not necessarily
asserted that the price-levels of all countries must be
equal&mdash;the facts too obviously contradict that. But when
this precise statement is not made, the substitute statement
of some "normal" relation between the price-level
of one country and that of another becomes a very vague
one, and the theory becomes pretty indefinite.</p>

<p>I am here concerned chiefly with one contention: the price-<i>level</i>,
the average of prices, is not a <i>cause</i> of anything&mdash;not
of gold movements or anything else. It is a mere summary
of many concrete prices. Some of these concrete
prices have highly important influence on international
gold movements, tending, if they are low, to bring gold in,
and if they are high, to repel gold. Others work in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
opposite direction, tending if they are low to attract less gold
than if they are high. Finally, among all the prices affecting
international gold movements, the one which is most significant
is commonly not included in the price-level at all: I refer
to the "price of money," the short-time interest rate.</p>

<p>Let me elaborate each point. First, it is true that high
prices of articles which enter easily into international
trade tend to repel gold from the country&mdash;meaning by
"high prices" prices that are higher than the prices of the
same goods abroad. This relates, however, not to the
general price-level, but only to a comparatively small set
of prices. Most prices in a country are not prices of articles
of international trade. High wages may, indeed, draw in
immigrants. But high land rents, and high prices of land
cannot bring in land. Nor do high land prices send away
much gold to other countries for the purchase of land
there. Indeed, within a single country, the differences
in the relation between land yield and capital value of land
are enormous. The following figures are taken from an
article by J. E. Pope:<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> In Yazoo Co., Mississippi, farm
lands are sold at $10 to $25 per acre. The average gross
income per acre is $28. In Cass Co., Iowa, the land prices
are from $100 to $125 per acre while the gross income
amounts to only $11 per acre, if only crops and dairy
products are taken into account, and to $20 if the sales of
live stock are included. In Oglethorpe Co., Georgia, the
average price is from $10 to $25 per acre, and the average
income $10. In Paulding Co., Ohio, land is sold at from
$75 to $100 per acre, and the average income per acre, including
returns from live stock sold, is $15. Why should
not landowners in Cass County, Iowa, sell their comparatively
unproductive land, at a high price, and go, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
their money, to Yazoo County, Mississippi? The answer
is simply, that they would have to go <i>with</i> their money, and
they prefer to stay at home! Absentee landlordism is not
generally popular with men who are seeking paying investments.
Land stands at one extreme. But then land
is the very biggest item in an inventory of wealth, and,
while not <i>as land</i>, actively bought and sold,<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> it is a big element
in the values of many active securities. The principle
holds in less degree of many other things, however.
The securities of a local corporation, say a gas plant, find
their best market at home, as a rule, unless the city be
large. If they are held by foreign capitalists, they still
find a very restricted market in the foreign country. Only
those who have investigated at first hand will feel free in
buying them&mdash;unless, indeed, they are guaranteed in some
way by a big and well-known house. Prices of personal
and professional services vary enormously in different
sections of the same country, to say nothing of variations
between different countries, and there is a very slow movement
indeed toward bringing about higher salaries for rural
preachers in Kansas because the salaries of London
preachers have risen, or because of increased demand for
preachers in Germany. Great numbers of commodities are
too bulky to move far. Their prices vary with little relation
to similar prices elsewhere. But the principle needs no more
elaboration. If the reasoning be simply that men tend to
buy where things are cheap, and to sell where things are
dear, it is clear that that establishes a very loose relation indeed
between the price-levels of different countries.</p>

<p>The second point is that some prices, by rising, actually
bring in gold from abroad, while by falling they tend to re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>lease
gold. I am not here referring to the case discussed in
the chapter on "Supply and Demand," where a commodity,
cotton, with an inelastic demand, is doubled, the doubled
quantity selling for a less aggregate price, and so bringing
in less money from abroad. That case would bear considerable
generalization. I am referring here to the case
where <i>credit</i> is built on the value of long time goods, as
lands, or railroads. Concretely, let us suppose an increase
in railroad rates allowed by the Public Service Commission
of Missouri. This is, in itself a rise in prices. It will,
further, on the capitalization theory, make the prices of
stocks of the roads operating in the State rise also, and give
a margin of additional security for bond-issues. This will
make it possible for these roads to float foreign loans (or
would have done so before the War), and so will tend to
turn the exchanges in our favor. Gold will tend to come
in, not to go out. Similarly if the prices of dairy products,
or truck gardens, or orchards, or orange groves rise, leading
to a rise in the prices of the lands involved, foreign capital
will tend to come in as loans&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the exchanges will turn
more favorable to us, and the gold movement tend to turn
our way. I suppose, by the way, that something of a point
could be made against the Single Tax at this point: destroying
land values would lessen the security which a community
could offer outside lenders. The Single Tax would,
thus, hamper the development of countries which need
capital from outside. Men who wish to use their own
capital, under their own management, might, as the Single
Taxers claim, be tempted to come in, if they could be free
from taxation on the capital they bring with them; but
<i>lenders</i>, who wish a good margin of security, would find less
inducement to lend.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> This is a digression, but one feature<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
of it is pertinent: though the foreigner does not care to
migrate from his high-priced land to <i>low</i>-priced land elsewhere,
he is often willing to trust a <i>loan</i> to the owner of
<i>high</i>-priced land elsewhere. I will not venture the generalization
that high-priced land necessarily attracts loans, and
tends to turn the gold movements in favor of the country
where prices are high. The point has been made that if
lands are being exchanged frequently, the new buyer tends
to exhaust his credit resources in paying for the land: <i>i. e.</i>,
puts so large a mortgage on it that he has little margin of
security to offer for working capital.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> I shall not here
undertake to determine how far as a matter of fact, in
different places, the one tendency outweighs the other. It
is enough to point out that in many cases, where this factor
is absent (as in the case of the railroads cited), rising prices
attract, and do not repel, foreign gold, and that for none of
these cases is the consequence of rising prices for the gold
movements to be explained in the simple way that the
quantity theory doctrine would require.</p>

<p>Finally, the international movements of gold<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> are
enormously moved by the short-time rate of interest. The
raising of the Bank Rate in England, supplemented, when
necessary, by "borrowing from the market" by the Bank
of England, as a means of making the Bank Rate effective,
quickly turns the course of the exchanges. This is, as has
been pointed out, a more effective device when used by
the English money-market than when used by borrowing
countries, since the borrower, by offering higher rates, is
not always able to borrow more, whereas the lender, by
demanding higher rates, is usually able to reduce his loans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
But the difference is one of degree, and in point of fact a
rise in the short time rates in New York City is commonly
an effective means of bringing in gold from abroad. It is
true that this is not the only factor. I have been at pains
to point out how other factors work. I am as far as possible
from denying the powerful influence of the "balance
of trade" as treated by the older economists on international
gold movements, when both visible and invisible
items are included. But my point is, first, that these invisible
items are numerous and flexible, and that a big factor
in their determination is the short time rate of interest;
and second, that the balance of physical items, even, depends,
not on the price-level as a whole, but merely on the
prices of those particular goods which enter into foreign
trade. It is perfectly possible, and, indeed, is very common,
for rising prices in a country to lead to expanding
trade and expanding bank-credit, which causes bankers to
wish to expand their reserves, which leads them to raise
their rates on short time loans, which leads gold to come
in from abroad. More simply still, the bankers may
merely offer an attractive rate to the foreign bankers, and
establish credits abroad, against which they draw "finance
bills," which influence the gold movements in the desired
manner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVII</h3>

<h3>THE QUANTITY THEORY <i>vs.</i> GRESHAM'S LAW</h3>


<p>There is a pretty obvious conflict between the quantity
theory and Gresham's Law. The latter is, essentially, a
"<i>quality</i>" theory of money. For the quantity theory,
dodo-bones, or anything else will do. "It is the number,
and not the weight, that is essential"!<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> For Gresham's
Law, the weight makes all the difference in the world, if it
is a question as between full weight and light weight coins,
and, in general, the <i>value</i> of the thing of which money is
made, considered in its commodity aspect, is the starting
point of that doctrine.</p>

<p>The quantity theorist seeks, indeed, to harmonize the
two. His theory is that Gresham's Law manifests itself only
when there is a <i>redundancy</i> of the currency due to the issue
of paper money, or overvalued metal. In such a case,
prices rise, he holds, and then the undervalued metal, or
the metallic currency, which count no more than the paper
or the overvalued metal in circulation, tend to leave the
country, to another country where prices are lower, or
tend to leave the money use for the arts. But the quantity
theorist must maintain that it is only <i>via</i> increased issue,
with consequent rising prices, that Gresham's Law comes
into operation. If there are a million dollars of gold in
circulation, and a half million of irredeemable paper is
added, then only half a million of the gold (or rather a little
less than half) will leave. If more than that left, prices
would fall, because of the scarcity of money, and then the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
gold would come back, because it would be worth more in
concurrent circulation with the paper than it would be
worth as money abroad, or in the arts. On the quantity
theory, there can be no difference in the value of gold and
paper, in such a case, after enough gold has left to balance
the paper that has been issued. Falling prices would prevent
it.</p>

<p>But Gresham's Law is not held by any such fetters!
And the facts of monetary history, in important cases,
show Gresham's Law controlling, despite the quantity
theory. I will refer briefly to two such cases.</p>

<p>The first centres about the suspension of specie payments
by the Northern banks and the Federal Treasury on
January 1, 1862. This suspension was not accompanied by
any increase of money. Rather, there was a <i>decrease</i>,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
shortly following, in the amount of paper money. The
banks in New York, and certain other States, were bound so
strictly by their charters, and by the State laws, that they
dared not leave their notes unredeemed. Speculators, buying
notes at a discount&mdash;for virtually all bank-notes fell to a
discount&mdash;were able to present them to the banks in these
States and demand gold, which led to a very profitable
business. The banks protected their gold by ceasing to
issue notes, or by reducing the volume of note issue. Certified
checks were used to a considerable extent instead.
There was certainly no increase, and probably a reduction,
a considerable reduction, in the volume of bank-notes in
circulation. The only other paper money in circulation
was the Demand Notes of the Federal Government, which
were not increased after the date of the suspension, and
which were in any case small in volume as compared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
with the total amount of money. On the quantity theory
version of Gresham's Law, there was nothing to drive gold
out. Gold was <i>not pushed out</i> by redundant currency.
Rather, it <i>left</i>, leaving a monetary vacuum behind. Coincidently,
strangely enough, prices <i>rose</i>. The vacuum in
the money supply was so serious, that the subsequent first
issue of the Greenbacks brought a welcome relief. Throughout
the whole of the first year of the suspension, the volume
of money was less than it had been in the preceding year.
None the less, the gold stayed out of general circulation.
It did not come back from abroad. And prices <i>rose</i>.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></p>

<p>A similar episode, the obverse of this, occurred when the
Bank of England <i>resumed</i> specie payments in the early
'20's. Then gold came back, the currency was increased,
and, coincidently, <i>prices fell</i>.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a></p>

<p>I conclude that the conflict between Gresham's Law and
the quantity theory is real and fundamental, and that in
cases where different <i>qualities</i> of money are in concurrent
circulation, the undervalued money will leave, regardless
of the question of quantity.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII</h3>

<h3>THE QUANTITY THEORY AND "WORLD PRICES"</h3>


<p>Some writers, who would call themselves quantity
theorists, would repudiate many of the doctrines for which
Fisher stands, and which the historical quantity theory
involves. The recognition which Fisher's book has received
from quantity theorists generally, justifies me in
treating his book as the "official" exposition of the modern
quantity theory, and, indeed, it is easy to show that Fisher
is fundamentally true to the quantity theory tradition.
With many writers, the disagreement with Fisher would
be a mere matter of degree; they would hold that Fisher
has set forth the central principle, that his qualitative
reasoning is correct, but that the relations among the factors
in his equation are less rigid than he maintains. As I
reject even the qualitative reasoning by which Fisher defends
his doctrine, and reject even the qualitative tendency
which he maintains, my criticisms will apply as well to the
position of this group of writers, though I should have less
practical differences with them, to the extent that they
admit qualifications and exceptions to Fisher's doctrine.</p>

<p>There is, however, a group of writers who seem to feel
that the quantity theory remains sufficiently vindicated
if it can be shown that an increase in <i>gold production</i> tends
to raise prices throughout the world, while a check on gold
production tends to lower prices, and who rest their case
on the necessity which bankers find of keeping reserves in
some sort of relation to the expansions of bank-credit.</p>

<p>A view of this sort is presented by J. S. Nicholson, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
statement of the application of the quantity theory to the
modern world differs almost <i>toto coelo</i> from his original
statement in the dodo-bone illustration already discussed.
Nicholson<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> declares that in our modern society "the
quantity of <i>standard</i> money, other things remaining the
same, determines the general level of prices, whilst, on the
other hand, the quantity of <i>token</i> money is determined by
the general level of prices." Nicholson's reasoning is,
substantially, as follows: Although the bulk of exchanging
is carried on by means of credit devices, there is still a
certain part of exchanging, especially in the matter of paying
balances, for which standard money only can be used.
He regards the whole credit system as based on standard
money, and says that for any given level of prices there is a
minimum amount of standard money, absolutely demanded.
If the volume of standard money falls below this minimum,
the price-level will fall to such a point that the volume of
standard money is again adequate. He takes, moreover,
a world-wide view, declaring that it is the relation between
the volume of gold money throughout the world and the
demand for standard money throughout the world which
determines the relative values of money and commodities.
"The measure of values or the general level of prices
throughout the world will be so adjusted that the metals
used as currency, or as the basis of substitutes for currency,
will be just sufficient for the purpose. We see then, that
the value of gold is determined in precisely the same manner
as that of any other commodity, according to the equation
between supply and demand."</p>

<p>In the consideration of this doctrine, let us note several
points in which it differs fundamentally from the quantity
theory proper, and from the situation assumed in the dodo-bone
illustration. First, it is not a quantity theory of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
<i>money</i>. Money is not regarded as a homogeneous thing,
each element having the same influence on prices. Rather,
<i>token</i> money is the child of prices. This doctrine would in
no way fit in with the logic of the equation of exchange, as
presented by Fisher. Further, the dodo-bone idea is entirely
gone. <i>Gold</i>, a commodity with value in non-monetary
employments, is under discussion, and it is the quantity
of gold that is counted significant. This recognizes,
if not the need, at least the <i>existence</i>, of a commodity
standard. Nicholson definitely avows the necessity for
the <i>redemption</i> of representative money, even going so far
as to say that "all credit rests on a gold basis,"<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> that all
instruments of exchange derive their value from the volume
of standard money which supports them, and that if
this basis were cut away the whole structure would fall.
Nicholson recognizes, further, that gold has value independent
of its use as money.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

<p>In evaluating Nicholson's doctrine, I wish to point out,
first, the inaccuracy of the statement that all credit rests
on a gold basis. It is true that credit instruments are
commonly drawn in terms of standard money, which is
commonly gold. International credit instruments may
even specify gold, and the same thing happens at times
within a country. But commonly, in this connection,
gold functions, not as the value basis lying behind the
credit instrument, the existence of which justifies the extension
of the credit, but rather as the <i>standard of deferred
payments</i>, by means of which the credit instrument may be
made definite. The real basis of the value of a mortgage
is not a particular sum of gold, but rather the value of the
farm, expressed in terms of gold. The basis of a bill of
exchange is not a particular sum of gold, but rather is the
value of the goods which changed hands when the bill of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
exchange was drawn,<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> supplemented by the other possessions
of drawer, drawee, and the endorsers through whose
hands it has gone. Even a note unsecured by a mortgage,
or not given in payment for a particular purchase, is based,
in general, on the value of the general property of the man
who gives it, and on the value of his anticipated income.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
So throughout. Credit transactions, for the most part,
originate in exchanges, and carry their own basis of security
in the goods and securities which change hands, not in that
small fraction of the world's wealth, the stock of gold,
which could, Coin Harvey asserted in the middle '90's, be
put in the Chicago grain-pit! And now let me extend this
idea. Although coin made from the standard of value is
a great convenience, there is yet no vital need, in theory,
for a single dollar, pound or franc made from the standard
of value. If gold should cease entirely to be used as a
medium of exchange, or in bank or government reserves, if
the gold dollar should become a mere formula, so many
grains of gold, without there being any coins made of it,
still, so long as that number of grains had a definite, ascertainable
value, commensurate with the value of some other
commodity which could be used as a means of paying
balances and redeeming representative money, the gold
dollar could still serve as a measure and standard of values.
In the situation I have assumed, silver bullion, at the market
ratio, could perform all the exchange and reserve functions
now performed by gold, even though not so conveniently.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a>
Nicholson's description of the use of gold as a
reserve, while calling attention to an important fact, has led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
him into the error of supposing that what may be true of
gold, the <i>medium of exchange</i>, and <i>reserve for credit operations</i>
is necessarily true of the <i>standard of value as
such</i>.</p>

<p>Nicholson is correct, however, in looking to the standard
of value for part of the explanation of changes in prices.
And, <i>since it so happens</i> that a considerable part of the
value of the standard of value comes from its employment
as medium of exchange and reserve, he is correct in looking
to its use as money as part of the explanation of its
value. His error comes, however, in failing to see that
independent changes in the values of goods may also change
the price-level, and that variations in the demand for gold
as a commodity may also change the value of gold, and so
change the price-level.</p>

<p>Further, in so far as Nicholson clings to the notion of
prices as depending on a mechanical equilibration of physical
quantities, he is subject to the criticisms given before of
the general quantity theory, and in so far as he clings to the
identity of the value of gold with the reciprocal of the price-level,&mdash;the
relative conception of value&mdash;he is subject to
the criticisms already urged.</p>

<p>Again, even for a single country, the connection between
volume of reserves and volume of credit is very loose and
shifting. A thousand factors besides volume of standard
money in a country determine the expansions and contractions
of credit, and the long run average of credit. For the
whole world, this connection is even looser. To assume a
fixed ratio between them for the whole world, one would
have to assume that all the world was simultaneously, and
normally, straining its possibility of credit expansion to the
utmost, so that the minimum ratio&mdash;a notion which is far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>from precise<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>&mdash;should also be the normal maximum, and
so that no country, in expanding its credit, could draw in
new reserves from other countries which had more quiescent
business conditions.</p>

<p>Nicholson's notion of the world price-level, moreover, is
subject to the criticisms I have made in the chapter on
"The Quantity Theory and International Gold Movements."
How can the world level have a close connection
with the volume of gold, if different elements in the world
price-level, the price-levels of different countries, can vary
so widely and divergently as compared with one another?
Even granting&mdash;which I do not grant, and which I maintain
I have disproved&mdash;that the price-level in one country
has a close connection with its stock of gold, would it not
be true that the average price-level for the world would
vary greatly, with the same world stock of gold, depending
on which countries had the gold?</p>

<p>There is nothing in Nicholson's doctrine which seems to
me to justify in any degree the doctrine that prices, in a
single country, or in the world at large, show any tendency
to <i>proportional</i> variation with the quantity of money, or
with the world's stock of gold.</p>

<p>Is it not true, then, that there is <i>some</i> sort of relation
between gold production and world prices? It is. Gold
is like other commodities. Its value tends to sink as its
quantity is increased. As its value sinks, prices tend to
rise. As to the elasticity in the value-curve for gold, I
think it will be best to reserve discussion till a later chapter,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
in Part III. We shall there find reason for thinking
that gold has much greater elasticity in this respect than
most other commodities. That its value should fall <i>proportionately</i>
with an increase in its quantity, I should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
at all conclude. Even if its value did sink proportionately
with an increase, prices would rise proportionately only if
the values of goods remained unchanged.</p>

<p>But why do we need a <i>quantity theory</i> of <i>money</i>,
with all its artificial assumptions, and its law of strict proportionality,
to enable us to assert the simple fact that
gold, like other commodities, has a value not independent
of its quantity? What theory of money would deny it?
Surely not the commodity or bullionist theory. For that
theory, which seeks the explanation of the value of money
in the value of gold in the arts, it would go without saying
that an increase in the supply of gold for the arts would
lower its value there and consequently, its value as money.
Surely the theory which I shall maintain in Part III of
this book will not deny that increased gold production tends
to lower the value of money, and consequently to raise
prices. With the "quantity theorist" who is content with
this conclusion, I have no quarrel&mdash;unless he claims this
obvious truth as the unique possession of the quantity
theory!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX</h3>

<h3>STATISTICAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE
QUANTITY THEORY&mdash;THE REDISCOVERY OF A
BURIED CITY</h3>


<p>In the following chapter, as in most of the preceding
chapters, constructive doctrine is aimed at, even though
the discussion takes, in considerable part, the form of
critical analysis of opposing views. We shall seek to set
forth the facts, as far as may be, regarding the relations of
banking transactions to trade, the relations of clearings to
amounts deposited in banks, the relation of New York
City clearings to country clearings, and of New York bank
transactions to bank transactions in the rest of the country.
We shall seek to ascertain the extent of variability in that
highly elusive magnitude, "velocity of circulation," particularly
"V&acute;." We shall indicate something of the bearing
of index numbers of prices on the theory of the value of
money as here presented. In reaching conclusions on these
and related matters, we shall build on the investigations
of Dean Kinley, on the very interesting statistical studies
of Kemmerer and Fisher based on Kinley's figures, on investigations
more recently made by the American Bankers'
Association regarding the relation of bank transactions and
bank clearings, on figures from reports by the Comptroller
of the Currency, as well as on other sources. One purpose
of the chapter is to criticise the statistics which purport to
prove the quantity theory. The bulk of the chapter is
given to this. But the work of Fisher and Kemmerer thus
criticised yields rich rewards for the study. The conclusions
they have drawn from their figures are, in the judg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>ment
of the writer, untenable, but the figures themselves
are of immense interest and importance.</p>

<p>The controversy over the quantity theory has been
waged with many weapons. Theory, history, and statistics&mdash;to
say nothing of invective!&mdash;have been freely
employed. In large measure, the statistical studies have
been concerned with the direct comparison of quantity of
money and prices, in their variations from year to year.
One of the best of these studies, that of Professor Wesley C.
Mitchell, in his <i>History of the Greenbacks</i> (followed by his
<i>Gold, Prices and Wages under the Greenback Standard</i>), has,
to the minds of many students, including the present
writer, put it beyond the pale of controversy that the
fluctuations in the gold premium, and in the level of prices,
in the United States during the Greenback period, both for
long periods and for daily changes, were not occasioned by
changes in the quantity of money,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> but rather, primarily,
by military and political events, and other things affecting
the credit of the Federal Government, together with
changes affecting the values of gold and of goods. Professor
Mitchell's discussion is so detailed and thorough,
that what controversy remains relates, not to his facts, but
rather to the possibility of interpreting those facts in harmony
with the quantity theory, by repudiating the notion
that the direct comparison of gold premiums or of prices
with quantity of money gives a valid test.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>Recent defenders of the quantity theory have undertaken
the examination of more complex statistics than those concerned
with the simple concomitance of quantity of money
and prices. Two of these studies, the first by Professor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>Kemmerer<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> and the second by Professor Fisher, are so
elaborate, have commanded such general attention, and
have been accepted by so many students as conclusive
demonstrations, that I feel it proper to give them detailed
examination. I do this especially because highly important
facts for our construction argument emerge from this critical
examination. Kemmerer's and Fisher's studies reach
high-water mark in the effort to give statistical demonstrations
of the quantity theory. If they are invalid, then I
know no other attempts which many students would suppose
to be possible substitutes. The theory involved in
both these studies is clearly stated by Professor Kemmerer:
"A study of this kind, to be of any value, must cover the
monetary demand as well as the monetary supply. Any
test of the validity of the quantity theory consisting merely
of a comparison of the amount of money in circulation
with the general price-level is as worthless as would be a
test of the power of a locomotive by a simple reference to
its speed without taking into account the load it was carrying
or the grade it was moving over." This criticism of
many previous studies is, in general, I think, valid, though
I should except from this list such detailed studies as that
of W. C. Mitchell, who takes account, as far as may be,
of all the variables involved, and who considers day by day
and week by week changes. I think the older studies of
Tooke,<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> may also be excepted. In point of fact, if one
wishes to know how much reliance may be placed in the
quantity theory as a basis for prediction, when one knows
that money is increasing, the simple comparison of money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
and prices is a fair test. If the "other things" which must
be "equal" are so numerous and complex that the quantity
theory cannot manifest itself in a direct comparison, much
of its significance <i>as a basis of prediction</i> is gone.</p>

<p>It is perfectly true, however, that studies running through
long periods, which give simply figures for general prices
and figures for quantity of money, omitting volume of
trade, are not very relevant either for proof or disproof.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a>
And the conception underlying the studies of Kemmerer
and Fisher, that not merely money and prices, but also
volume of bank-credit, volume of trade, velocity of monetary
circulation, and velocity of bank-credit, must be measured,
undoubtedly represents a big advance in the conception
of the statistical problem involved. The mere stating
of the problem is an intellectual achievement of no mean
order, and the ingenuity and scholarship involved in seeking
data for concrete measurement of these highly elusive
elements must command the admiration of every student
of monetary problems. Volume of trade, velocity of money
and velocity of bank-credit had been generally supposed,
until these studies were undertaken, to be beyond the reach
of the statistician. There can be no doubt at all that the
efforts to measure them, or to measure variations in them,
by Kemmerer and Fisher, have greatly advanced our general
knowledge of the phenomena of money and credit.</p>

<p>With great admiration for the magnificence of the problem
undertaken, and for the industry, ingenuity and
scholarship which have been devoted to its solution, I have
nevertheless reached the conclusion that the figures assigned
by these writers to the magnitudes of their "equations
of exchange" are, with the exceptions of the figures
for money and deposits, widely at variance from the real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
facts in the case, and second, that if they were correct,
they could in no sense be said to constitute proof of the
quantity theory.</p>

<p>In the critical analysis which follows, chief attention will
be devoted to Fisher's statistics. His is the later study,
and it follows, in main outlines, the methods laid down
by Kemmerer. He has employed Kemmerer's statistics
in considerable part, amplifying them for later years, using
some data not available when Kemmerer wrote, and undertaking
a fuller solution of certain problems than Kemmerer
did. I shall, however, from time to time make reference
to Kemmerer's figures, and show points of difference between
the two studies.</p>

<p>Let me first briefly state the second point of my criticism
of these studies: namely, that even if the statistics are correct,
they do not constitute proof of the quantity theory.
The statistics purport to be concrete data filling out for
different years the equation of exchange.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> But the equation
of exchange, as we have seen, does not prove the quantity
theory. The quantity theory is a <i>causal</i> theory, and
causation involves an order <i>in time</i>. The concrete figures
for the equation do not prove that. Even Kemmerer's
concluding chart on p. 148, showing a rough concomitance
between "relative circulation" and general prices does not
show that changes in relative circulation are <i>causes</i> of
changes in general prices. The causation might be the
reverse for anything his figures tell us. Fisher himself
recognizes this, in considerable degree: "As previously remarked,
to establish the equation of exchange is not completely
to establish the quantity theory of money, for the
equation does not reveal which factors are causes and which
are effects."<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Again: "But, to a candid mind, the quantity
theory, in the sense in which we have taken it, ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
appear sufficiently secure without such checking. Its best
proof must be <i>a priori</i>."<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The main criticism here, however, relates to the figures
themselves, rather than to their meaning. The figures
given by Professor Fisher are concrete magnitudes to fill
out his equation of exchange, MV + M&acute;V&acute; = PT<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> for the
years since 1896. Thus, for 1909, the figures are: M = 1.61
billions; M&acute; = 6.68 billions; V = 21.1; V&acute; = 52.8; P = $1;
T = 387 billions.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Now in what follows, I shall challenge all these estimates
except P for 1909, V for 1896 and 1909, and M and M&acute; for
all years. The figures for M and M&acute;, being the results of
fairly simple computations based on Governmental statistics,
need not be questioned. P for 1909 is arbitrarily
placed at $1.00. V for 1896 and 1909, for reasons which
will later appear, is better based than for other years,
though Kemmerer and Fisher have differed greatly in
their estimates for V, the former placing it at 47 and the
latter at 18 or 20.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> My criticisms with reference to V,
however, will relate to the years other than 1909 and 1896.</p>

<p>The sources from which these absolute magnitudes are
drawn are, primarily, two investigations by Dean David
Kinley, one in 1896 and the other in 1909, in co&ouml;peration
with the Comptroller of the Currency.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> The purpose of
these investigations was to ascertain the proportions of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
checks and money in payments in the United States. Banks
of all kinds, national and State banks, trust companies,
private banks, etc., were requested by the Comptroller to
supply data for a given day (March 16 in 1909) showing
what their customers deposited on that day. They were
asked to classify these deposits as cash, on the one hand,
and as checks, drafts, etc. on the other. They were also
asked to give a cross classification of the same deposits, as
"retail deposits," "wholesale deposits," and "all other deposits."
In 1909, over 12,000 banks of all kinds, out of
about 25,000 banks, replied, and of these replies 11,492
were in available form. These replies showed a total of
deposits of over 688 millions of dollars. Of this total, 647
millions were in checks, so that checks made up 94.1% of
the whole. About 60 millions of this total were retail deposits,
about 125 millions were wholesale deposits, and the
rest, about 503 millions, were classed in the "all other"
category. Kinley's use of these figures, <i>for his purpose</i>,
seems to me in every way conclusive and safe. He was
interested merely in the question of the <i>proportions</i> of checks
and money in <i>payments</i>, retail, wholesale, and "<i>all other</i>."
The absolute magnitudes of the elements in the equation
of exchange he was not trying to measure. Professor
Fisher's use of the figures presents a different problem.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Let us consider, first, Professor Fisher's estimate of M&acute;V&acute;,
taken together. M&acute;V&acute; is considered to be equal to the
total amount (in dollars) of checks deposited during the
year.<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> To get this, for 1909, Kinley's figure, above, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
checks deposited in 11,492 banks on March 16, 1909, is
used. This figure is 647 millions. As half the banks had
not reported, an estimate for the non-reporting banks was
obtained from Professor Weston, who had aided Dean
Kinley in the investigation, and who had access to the
original data. Professor Weston estimated the total
checks deposited during the day at 1.02 billions.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The
question then arose as to whether this day was typical for
the year. Professor Fisher found New York City bank
clearings of March 17 (the day after, on which these
checks would get into the clearings) to be 28% below the
average for the year. He assumed the rest of the country
to be half as abnormal as New York City, and increased
the 1.02 billions to 1.20 billions, getting what he conceived
to be the daily average of checks deposited in the United
States in 1909. Multiplying this figure by 303, the number
of banking days in New York City (and so, presumably, a
fair average for the number of banking days in the country),
he obtained 364 billions for the checks deposited in 1909.
This figure he considered to be M&acute;V&acute;, the volume of bank
deposits,<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> multiplied by its velocity of circulation. To
obtain V&acute;, therefore, his problem was simple: he divided
the figure for M&acute;V&acute; by the figure for M&acute; previously obtained
from government statistics, and obtained V&acute;.</p>

<p>Now I wish to call attention to three important errors
involved in this calculation of M&acute;V&acute; for 1909. (1) The
assumption that the total check circulation is the same as
the volume of checks actually used in <i>trade</i> is a violent one.
<i>Payments</i> may be tax payments, loans and repayments,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
gifts, what not. Many checks may be used in a single
transaction. Surely not all of this is properly to be counted
in the M&acute;V&acute; of the equation of exchange. But this topic
is better discussed in connection with the estimate for T,
and I reserve its fuller discussion till then. (2) The assumption
that the rest of the country was abnormal in its clearings
on March 17, 1909, is a pure assumption, which investigation
does not verify. The rest of the country was,
in fact, nearly normal! The error that comes for the year
from increasing the total on this assumption amounts to
at least 31 billions! The total for the year, on Professor
Fisher's method of computation, with the correction to
make the assumption regarding outside clearings correspond
with the facts, is 333 billions, instead of 364 billions! As
the figure for 1909 is a basic figure, on which figures for
other years are calculated, this error is extremely significant.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>(3) A yet more serious error in this computation is the
assumption that New York City was complete in Kinley's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
figures, while the rest of the country was incomplete. This
error, as we shall see, largely neutralizes the error above, so
far as the "finally adjusted" figure for 1909 is concerned,
but it makes a vital difference in the figures for other years,
as will appear, since it affects the "weighting" of New
York clearings and outside clearings in the index of variation
by means of which M&acute;V&acute; for years other than 1909 is
determined. The assumption that New York is complete,
in Kinley's figures, and that all of the extra hundreds of
millions added by Professor Weston in his estimate for the
non-reporting banks belongs to the country outside New
York, is made by Professor Fisher both on pp. 444-445, in
estimating M&acute;V&acute; for 1909, and on p. 446, in finding an index
of variation for M&acute;V&acute;. The only reason given, so far as I
can find, is the following: "This figure, <i>being for New York</i>,
[Italics mine], is probably nearly complete." (<i>Loc. cit.</i>, p.
446.) With this as a basis, Professor Fisher proceeds in
his calculations to treat the figure for New York, 239 millions,
as absolutely complete, and gives the rest of Professor
Weston's 1.02 billions for the day, or 786 millions,
to the country outside. The error above mentioned, of
assuming the rest of the country to be abnormally low on
March 17 in its clearings, still further increases the amount
assigned to the rest of the country in the total figures for
the year.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> The conclusion finally is that New York had
deposits of 93 billions in checks for the year, while the rest
of the country had deposits of 271 billions in checks. As
New York clearings for the year were 104 billions, while
clearings for the rest of the country were only 62 billions,
Professor Fisher concludes that New York clearings overcount
New York check deposits, and outside clearings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
greatly undercount outside check deposits, so that, in the
index of variation of check deposits, for years other than
1909 and 1896, New York clearings should be given a
weight of only 1, while outside clearings should be weighted
by 5. "That is, on the basis of 1909 figures, five times the
outside clearings plus once the New York clearings should
be a good barometer of check transactions." (P. 447.) All
this rests on the assumption that New York figures for
March 16, 1909, were complete, and the only reason assigned
is, "being from New York!"</p>

<p>Now the figures from New York were not complete.
And New York clearings do not overcount New York
check deposits. Outside clearings do not undercount outside
check deposits nearly to the extent that Professor
Fisher assumes. For each of these three statements I shall
offer what would seem to be conclusive evidence, and I
shall attempt to get an estimate of the real relation between
New York check transactions and check transactions
for the rest of the country.</p>

<p>First, the figures for New York were far from complete.
It may be noted that Dean Kinley, in his volume for 1909,<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
is very careful to repudiate the assumption that the cities
were complete more than the country: "Moreover, it is a
mere assumption that the non-reporting banks are mainly
the small banks in the country districts. <i>A great many city
banks also did not report.</i>" (Italics mine.) That this is true
for New York is abundantly evident from figures there
given for the private banks and the trust companies, not
to consider at all the State and national banks. New York
shows only $1,751 in checks deposited in the "all other
deposits" in private banks! This is a city which includes
among its private bankers J. P. Morgan &amp; Co.,
Kuhn, Loeb and Co., J. &amp; W. Seligman &amp; Co., and
others! Figures from these banks appear nowhere in Kinley's
totals, since deposits made <i>by</i> these banks in other
banks are also excluded from Kinley's figures.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Of course,
exact figures cannot be given to show how much New York
would be increased had the private banks made full reports.
We have no reports of any kind from these institutions.
Every feature of their business is kept from the lime light,
as far as possible&mdash;a practice which is much to be regretted,
since it arouses hostility and suspicion, where a statement
of the facts in the case would frequently entirely dispel
them. We have, however, some information regarding
the magnitude of their deposits, meaning by deposits, not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
what Kinley means in this investigation, namely, checks,
etc., <i>deposited</i> on a given day, but rather, deposits in the
balance sheet sense of demand obligations to depositors.
In Nov. 1912, J. P. Morgan and Co. held deposits of
$114,000,000, exclusive of 49 millions on deposit with their
Philadelphia branch of Drexel &amp; Co. About half of these
were deposits of interstate corporations. Kuhn-Loeb
held, on the average, for the six years preceding 1913 over
17 millions of deposits of interstate corporations. What
their aggregate deposits were, we do not know. These
figures are obtained from the report of the Pujo Committee.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a>
Morgan's deposits were equalled by only three banks and
two trust companies in New York (as of April 3, 1915),
and Kuhn-Loeb's deposits for interstate corporations alone
exceeded the total deposits of any one of the great majority
of the New York Clearing House banks and trust companies.
Of course, large deposits in the balance sheet sense need not
mean large deposits made on a given day. Private bankers'
deposits may be inactive. But we know, first, that half of
these figures for Morgan, and the whole of the figures given
for Kuhn-Loeb, represent the deposits of active business
corporations, engaged in interstate business. They are
not mere trust funds lying idle, or awaiting investment in
securities. What the rest are we can only conjecture.
That they are deposits of men and firms connected with the
Stock Exchange in some way is highly probable. The
whole drift of the statistics presented in this book, and of
the argument developed in this book, would serve to show
that such deposits are likely to be more than ordinarily
active.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> I refrain from assigning any figures as to the
amount of checks deposited in private banks in New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
on March 16, 1909. It must have run high into the millions.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a>
It certainly exceeded the two thousands, or less,
reported to Kinley! The figures for New York were, thus,
incomplete.</p>

<p>But the trust companies were also incomplete. The national
banks in New York reported checks totaling 186.5
millions, for all three classes of deposits; the State banks
reported only 38.1 millions; the trust companies only 14.2
millions. With aggregate deposits, as shown by their
balance sheets, exceeding the deposits of national banks<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a>
the New York City trust companies reported, as deposited
on March 16, 1909, less than half as much as the State
banks, less than a tenth as much as the national banks, and
only 6.8% of the two combined&mdash;5.9% of the total from
all three classes of institutions!</p>

<p>These figures are hard to reconcile with the assumption
that the trust companies in New York were complete on
that date.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible that the trust companies, though
having large deposits, have inactive deposits. This is sometimes
held to be the case. But that the difference is so
great in activity of deposit accounts between banks and
trust companies is hardly credible. I have looked into
this matter with considerable care, and have secured information
and opinions from men intimately acquainted with
the trust companies of New York from the inside. The
only available quantitative measure of the activity of deposits
would seem to be the volume of a bank's clearings.
This is not perfectly accurate, by any means, but it is the
best available test. Through the courtesy of a Vice President
of one of the largest New York trust companies, I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
obtained figures from an official of the Clearing House,
which show that in New York trust company clearings run
from 20 to 25% of the whole. On this basis, the trust
company figures for 1909 were incomplete to the extent of
from 33 millions to 46 millions, on the day in question.
These clearings figures, however, are for the year, 1915, and
not for the period before May, 1911, when the trust companies
were admitted to the Clearing House. Prior to that
time they did not deal directly with the Clearing House,
but <i>through</i> the member banks. Do these figures, therefore,
represent the situation as it existed in 1909? The
possibility was entertained that entering the Clearing
House had made a difference in the reserve policy of the
trust companies, and so had made them change the character
of their business, in such a way as to bring about
greater activity of accounts. This question was put to
the official of the trust company before mentioned, and his
reply is that the State law regarding reserves (passed after
the Panic of 1907) had already brought about this change
in reserve policy, and so no difference was made upon entering
the Clearing House.</p>

<p>The same gentleman, by the way, replying to a question
regarding the deposits in private banks in New York, and
the influence of such deposits on clearings, writes: "The
actual figures could not be obtained from the Clearing
House..., consequently can only say that deposits
made with these houses add to the Clearing House totals
very large sums."</p>

<p>There is one piece of evidence which would seem to
negative these conclusions regarding the trust companies.
In the Report of the New York State Superintendent of
Banks, for Dec. 31, 1907, p. xxxv, is a statement that
during the two years, 1903-05, the trust companies of
New York cleared only 7% as much as the banks. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
statement relates, however, to a period during which the
trust companies not only had no Clearing House membership,
which of course was true up to 1911, but also had
largely withdrawn from the privilege of clearing <i>through</i>
member banks.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> Under these circumstances, even 7%
would seem quite high. Inquiry was made of the Honorable
Clark Williams, who was State Superintendent of
Banks at the time the report was made, as to the source
of the figures.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Mr. Williams, in reply, defends the figures
as correct for that period, but authorizes the writer to
quote him as in no way surprised at the percentages given
above, 20 to 25% of the total clearings, in view of developments
and changes in trust company business.</p>

<p>I conclude that the trust company figures for March 16,
1909, were exceedingly incomplete. The national bank
figures were probably more nearly complete than any
others, first because they are large, and second, because
national banks would feel more obligation than other banks
to reply to questions from the Comptroller. The State
bank figures, 38.1 millions, as against national bank figures
of 186.5 millions, were probably incomplete also, to a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>siderable
extent, though State banks are not dominating
factors in New York City. That they should exceed the
figures for trust companies is surely evidence of the incompleteness
of the trust company figures. The private banks
are incomplete, with absolute certainty, since they are virtually
not represented at all.</p>

<p>Further evidence that the New York figures were incomplete,
however, will appear in the data regarding our
second thesis, namely, that New York clearings do not
overcount New York check deposits. The aggregate
check deposits reported from New York, on the date in
question, is 239 millions. Clearings for that day were 268
millions,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> substantially exceeding the reported check deposits.
Now do clearings exceed check deposits in New
York City?</p>

<p>Evidence with reference to outside clearings, in connection
with bank transactions, we now have in very definite
and abundant form, and it will be convenient to approach
the question of New York clearings, first, indirectly, <i>via</i>
country clearings. We shall, therefore, take up first the
thesis that clearings outside New York do not undercount
bank deposits outside New York nearly as much as Professor
Fisher thinks. According to his estimate, checks
deposited during the year in banks outside New York
(exclusive of checks deposited by one bank in another)
were 271 billions. (<i>Loc. cit.</i>, 446.) Outside clearings were
only 62 billions, and his conclusion is that the ratio of deposits
to clearings is 4.4 to 1, or, in other words, that outside
clearings amount to less than 22.8% of outside check
deposits.</p>

<p>Now an extensive investigation, covering the period
from June, 1913, to Oct. 1914, inclusive, has been made by
the American Bankers' Association, through Mr. O. How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>ard
Wolfe, Secretary of the Clearing House Section. This
investigation covered cities of various sizes, in various
parts of the country. Its results are immensely more
trustworthy than any results based on a single day, as Professor
Fisher's results are, could be, even had Professor
Fisher's method been otherwise correct. An account of
this investigation is to be found in the <i>Annalist</i> of Dec. 7,
1914.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> This investigation involves, for the period in question,
a comparison of "total bank transactions" in each
city with the clearings of that city, together with a summary
covering all the cities. "Total bank transactions" consist
of all debits against deposit liabilities of each member of the
Clearing House, whether they come through the Clearing
House or over the counter. They include payrolls, for example,
which, of course, never get into clearings. They include
drafts on deposits of one bank in another. In a letter
to the Editor of the <i>Annalist</i>, Mr. Wolfe states that "total
bank transactions include all debits against deposit liabilities,
whether by check, draft or charge ticket. The only
exceptions are certified checks and certain cashier's checks,
both of which to an extent represent a duplication." For
the period in question, clearings amounted, on the average,
for all cities, to 40% of "total transactions." The
cities did not include New York City, as stated.</p>

<p>Now we cannot apply this 40% at once to the question in
hand. Professor Fisher's 22.8% relates to the relation between
clearings and checks and drafts <i>deposited</i>, <i>excluding</i>
items deposited by banks, and excluding, of course, cash
deposited. What is the relation between Kinley's "deposits"
and Wolfe's "total transactions"?</p>

<p>It is clear that "total transactions" must, in a period of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
time, <i>exceed</i> Kinley's "deposits" very considerably. In a
general way, what goes out of a bank, and what comes into
a bank, must approximately equal one another in a period
of time. In a general way, a depositor finds his income and
his outgo balancing. Of course, some accumulate, paying
in more than they withdrew, but in general such accounts
are made with savings banks. The business man borrows
from his bank, getting a "deposit credit" (without "depositing"
in Kinley's sense), then checks against his "deposit,"
then receives checks in payments to himself, "deposits"
them, building up his deposit balance again, and
then checks against his deposit balance, in favor of the
bank, to pay off his loan. What comes in and what goes
out&mdash;abstracting from the growth of a rapidly expanding
bank&mdash;balance. But notice, in the case cited above, that
"total transactions" include more items than Kinley's
"deposits" show. When the bank makes a loan, and gives
a deposit credit, this does not, usually, show in Kinley's deposits.
When, however, the loan is paid off by a check to
the bank, it does show in "total transactions." Moreover,
when a man deposits cash in the bank, it does not show in
Kinley's figures for checks deposited. When, however, he
withdraws cash from the bank, or his check to another is
"cashed," it does appear in "total transactions." Further,
checks deposited to the credit of one bank in another do not
appear in Kinley's figures. Checks drawn, however, by one
bank on another do appear in total transactions. How great
the difference is between "total transactions" and "deposits"
in the banks outside New York we cannot say precisely.
The cash items alone, on the basis of Kinley's figures,
would make a difference of about 9%.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> To allow 11%<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
excess to "total transactions" over "deposits" for the
other reasons listed, is surely not to make an exaggerated
allowance. We thus count "deposits" in Kinley's sense, for
the banks outside New York City, as 80% of "total transactions."
Since, then, clearings are 40% of "total transactions,"
they will be 50% of "deposits." This figure is
more than twice as great as Professor Fisher's figure of
22.8%. Even if we counted deposits as equalling total
transactions, Professor Fisher's estimate would be clearly
very much too low.</p>

<p>How, then, do we stand? On Professor Fisher's showing,
the overwhelming bulk of checks deposited were in the
country outside New York&mdash;271 billions for the year, outside,
as against 93 billions in New York City. If the ratio
(50%) for outside clearings to deposits was the same for
1909 that it was in 1913-14 for the outside banks, we shall
have to revise this radically. We have 62 billions of country
clearings in 1909; we would have, then, 124 billions<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> of
country check deposits! If Fisher's total figure for the
country is correct, 353 billions as "finally adjusted," the
balance, or 229 billions, would belong to New York! New
York clearings, 104 billions, would thus be less than half
of New York deposits! If we count outside clearings for
1909 as only 40% of outside check deposits, outside deposits
would be, for 1909, only 155 billions, as against Professor
Fisher's 271 billions, <i>a difference of 116 billions</i>! I am sure
that his error in estimating outside check deposits is at
least as great as that, and that we cannot assign to New
York City less than a major part of the total check deposits
of the whole country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>This result fits in with the figures actually reported to
Dean Kinley, corrected to fit the known facts about March
17 clearings, better than Professor Fisher's estimate, by a
good margin. According to Professor Fisher's estimate,
New York City checks deposited are only 25.5% of the
total. Kinley's actual figures give 239 millions to New
York City, and 408 millions to the country outside. But
New York clearings were 28% below normal on March 17,
while country clearings were only 2.45% below normal.
Adding 28% to the figure for New York checks, we get
306 millions. Adding 2.45% to the outside checks, we get
418 millions. Of the total, 724 millions, New York checks
would be, then, 42.3%. We have shown reasons for considering
New York deposits to be very incomplete for
March 16, particularly as regards the private banks and
trust companies. Comparison of the New York figures
with the results indicated by the ratio of country clearings
to country deposits would thus indicate that New York was
much less complete than the country as a whole. Even
so, I need to add but 7.3% of the total to Kinley's actual
figures for New York, corrected in the light of next day
clearings, to give New York half of the check deposits.
Professor Fisher must subtract 16.8% of the total from the
actual figures for New York, as corrected in the light of
next day's clearings, in order to get his figure of 25.5%.
To vary as widely from the actually reported figures as
Professor Fisher does, I should have to assign 59.1% of
total check deposits to New York City. I refrain from
making an exact estimate. I am content with the conclusion
that something more than half of the checks deposited
in 1909 were in New York. This seems to be too
clear for serious controversy.</p>

<p>The indirect approach to the relation between New York
clearings and New York deposits, <i>via</i> the study of outside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
clearings in 1913 and 1914, taken in conjunction with the
figures for check deposits in 1909, would seem to make
it quite clear that New York clearings do not exceed
New York deposits, or, indeed, constitute a substantially
higher percentage of them than is the case with country
clearings and deposits.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> Logically, assuming the correctness
of the estimate for checks deposited, the case is complete:
we have a simple problem in arithmetic: given country
clearings for 1909, 62 billions; given the ratio of country
clearings to country deposits (and a minimum for this
ratio is clearly given, in the 40% which country clearings
are of "total transactions"), we can fix a maximum for
country deposits, which is 155 billions. Then, given our
estimate of 353 billions for total check deposits, we subtract
the maximum possible for country deposits from it, and
get a minimum possible for New York City of 198 billions
of check deposits. Comparing this with the known clearings
of 104 billions in New York, we find that New York
clearings constitute, as a maximum possible, 52.5% of New
York check deposits. If the reasons given for holding check
deposits in the country to be less than total transactions are
accepted, the ratio of clearings to deposits in New York
City is lower.</p>

<p>Indirect calculations, however, even when logically
complete, ought to be checked up by other methods, when
possible. We have some further data, drawn from an
earlier period, 1890-91-92, which suggest the same conclusion.</p>

<p>The reason commonly offered for holding that New York<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
clearings exaggerate local New York transactions, as compared
with country clearings and country transactions,
is that New York is the clearing house for the country.
Country banks send their idle cash there; country banks
pay other banks by drafts on their New York balances;
country banks send out of town checks to New York for
collection; business men in St. Louis pay business men in
Chicago with New York exchange, etc. These items are
supposed greatly to swell New York clearings.</p>

<p>Now several of these reasons are not at all valid. Cash
shipped back and forth between New York and the interior
does not get into clearings. Secondly, New York,
because of the charges made for collecting out of town
checks, has tended to lose much of the collection business.
Chicago probably does a great deal more of it than New
York does.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> However, even if checks on out of town
banks were sent largely to New York for collection, they
would not get into the clearings. New York banks send
checks on country banks directly to country correspondents.
Checks on out of town banks sent in for collection
do swell clearings in Boston and Kansas City, where arrangements
have been made, to the advantage of all concerned,
to have the clearing houses handle this business.
But New York has not made provision for it.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> The only
checks that get into New York clearings will be checks
drawn on New York banks.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>These checks will be of two kinds: (1) checks drawn by
individuals and firms on New York banks. These checks
will commonly be drawn by people in New York, and, in
so far as they come from out of town, will represent business
between New York and other places, hence, New
York business. (2) Drafts by banks on their New York
balances. These will be of three kinds: (a) drafts sold,
especially by country banks, to their customers who need
to make payments in other cities. Many of these will
represent payments to New Yorkers for transactions between
New York and the country, hence New York business,
and will appear in the check deposits of individuals,
firms, and corporations in New York, (b) There will also
be drafts from one country bank, on New York, to another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>country bank, in which New York is truly being used as a
clearing house, New York exchange taking the place of an
intercity shipment of cash.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> (c) Drafts by New York banks
on New York banks, to avoid deficits at the Clearing
House, or&mdash;especially in the case of private bankers, between
whom and brokers the line is hard to draw,&mdash;for
general purposes.</p>

<p>Now, fortunately, we have some data, trustworthy, even
though old, for the volume of bank-drafts on New York,
and, more important, for the proportion of drafts on New
York to drafts on banks in other cities. These figures are,
as stated, from the three years, 1890, 1891, and 1892. For
the purpose in hand, however, they are relevant, since
then, as now, New York clearings were nearly twice as
great, on the whole, as country clearings, and if this excess
of New York clearings is due to that cause, it should have
manifested itself in these figures. If the proportion of
these drafts on New York to the total of bank-drafts was
greater than the proportion of New York clearings of total
clearings, we might find reason for supposing that New
York clearings were unduly swelled by this fact. But in
fact, drafts on New York are not out of proportion. The
figures are virtually complete for drafts drawn by all the
national banks on national and other banks for the years
in question. They will be found in the Comptroller's
<i>Reports</i> for the three years, under the caption, "Domestic
Exchanges." For 1890 the figures are:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>The Comptroller (<i>Report</i> of 1890, p. 19) gives an estimate
for drafts drawn by State and private banks of an additional
6,089 millions. He does not try to apportion these among
New York and the other cities. There is no reason to suppose
that the percentage for these banks of drafts drawn
on New York would be higher than for national banks, and
there is some reason for supposing that they would be
lower: namely, that these institutions would lack the incentive
supplied by the National Bank Act for depositing
reserves in a Central Reserve City. The Comptroller's
figures probably do not include the great private banks in
New York, which deposit in New York commercial banks,
and draw huge checks against their deposits. These
checks, probably, however, chiefly represent stock exchange
collateral loans to brokers, and so appear in brokers' deposits
as well as in New York clearings&mdash;represent New
York deposits. I do not use this estimate in my computations.
If I did, the results, so far as proportions are concerned,
would be the same, since I could do nothing but
assign the same proportions to them. It will be seen that
my argument rests on the proportions, chiefly.</p>

<p>Now what difference would be made if we wiped out all
these draft transactions, and reduced clearings to correspond?
New York clearings in 1890 were 37,660 millions;
country clearings were 21,184 millions. Let us subtract
the drafts on New York from New York clearings, and the
drafts on other places from the country clearings. The re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>sult
is: New York clearings, 30,376 millions; country clearings,
16,918 millions. New York clearings still retain
their former status! New York clearings are still nearly
twice as great as country clearings! It is not the bank
drafts used in making New York the "clearing house" for
the country that swell New York clearings as compared
with the rest of the country! It is something else! The
main explanation, as we have in part seen, and shall further
see, is a mass of speculative transactions, chiefly Stock Exchange
transactions, and loan transactions connected
therewith! New York clearings grow out of New York
business, primarily.</p>

<p>The figures for the other two years vary little from those
of 1890. What variation there is shows a growth of drafts
on interior cities, and a decline of drafts on New York.
New York showed 63.07% of these drafts in 1890, 61% in
1891, and 60.77% in 1892.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>As we have seen, the only checks or drafts that get into
New York clearings are those drawn on New York banks.
The checks on New York banks probably almost all represent
business in which one party is a New York individual,
firm, or corporation. The drafts by out-of-town banks
will contain all the items, virtually, that represent "clearings"
through New York. Not all of these, by any means,
will represent such clearings. A very substantial part of
them will represent exchange sold to customers to make
payments in New York. We exaggerate the "clearing
through New York" when we subtract all these drafts
from New York clearings. Since, however, we treat
country clearings in the same way, no error results, so far
as the proportions between them are concerned.</p>

<p>The two sets of data converge. Both from the figures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
of 1913-14, in conjunction with estimated check circulation
in 1909, and from the figures of 1890-92, can we conclude
that New York clearings do not overcount New York
transactions. The conclusion would seem to be inevitable
that New York is really as important in our volume
of banking transactions as its clearings would indicate.
This may be qualified by a recognition of the possibility
that New York clearings are more efficient in handling
check deposits than are clearings in other cities. Some
scattering data from national banks for single days at a
time indicate that a higher percentage of checks is cleared
in New York than elsewhere in the country,<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> and one observation
for five national banks for a ten-day period shows
67% of checks deposited cleared.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> These checks include deposits
made by other banks, as do the figures of Kemmerer's
observations. But there are no direct observations covering
New York for a long enough period, or for enough institutions,
to warrant any definite conclusions.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>The
error of assuming clearings of March 17 in the
country outside New York to be abnormally low, swelled
Professor Fisher's total figure for check circulation by 31
billions, as we have seen. On the other hand, the error
of assuming New York City to be complete in Kinley's
figures tended to make the total smaller than it would have
been, since New York City was 28% below normal, and an
increase of 28% applied to half of Professor Weston's
figure of 1.02 billions, gives about 70 millions more for the
day, or 21 billions more for the year, than when the 28%
increase is applied to only a quarter of Professor Weston's
figure. These two errors roughly neutralize one another,
and we may accept Professor Fisher's "finally adjusted"
estimate of 353 billions<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> for the year as roughly approximating
the amount of checks deposited.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> How "rough"
an estimate one gets by taking a single day as the basis
for a year need not be here discussed. I should be disposed
to think that an indirect calculation, <i>via</i> clearings, in view
of our more extensive knowledge of the relation of clearings
to "total transactions," might well be worth more, so far
as deposits outside New York are concerned. Since, however,
we lack any extended figures for the relation of transactions
and clearings in New York, and since even for the
country we are obliged to make guesses as to the relation
of "checks deposited" to "total transactions," I refrain
from trying to improve further on Professor Fisher's
estimate for checks deposited in 1909&mdash;even though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
questioning that "check deposits" and M&acute;V&acute; are identical.</p>

<p>What, however, shall we say of M&acute;V&acute; for other years?
In the calculation of this, Professor Fisher relies on the
absolute figures for 1909 (and 1896, similarly calculated),
together with an "index" based on New York and country
clearings. In this index he weights country clearings by 5,<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
and New York clearings by 1. The result is, of course,
that country clearings dominate the index. But New
York clearings are much more variable than country clearings.
The range of variation in New York clearings for
the years 1897 to 1908, inclusive, is from 33.4 billions in
1897, to 104.7 billions, in 1906; the latter figure being
more than three times as great as the former. The range
in country clearings is from 23.8 billions, in 1897, to 57.8
billions, in 1907, the latter figure being 2<small><sup>10</sup>/<sub>23</sub></small> as great as
the former. But more significant is the degree of <i>year by
year</i> variability. The country clearings, with the exception
of 1908, always rise,&mdash;a steady, if not quite symmetrical,
increase. New York clearings, however, go up and
down, 42 billions in 1898, 60.8 billions in 1899, 52.6 billions
in 1900, 79.4 billions in 1901, 66.0 billions in 1903, 104.7
billions in 1906, 87.2 billions in 1907, 79.3 billions in 1908.
New York clearings are highly variable in both directions,
while country clearings vary almost wholly in one direction,
with a maximum difference of 6.4 billions between
any two consecutive years, and with an average yearly
variation of only 3.5 billions.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> When country clearings
are weighted by 5, almost all of the high degree of variability
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
of New York clearings is covered up, and volume of
checks deposited for years other than 1909 and 1896 is
thrown hopelessly away from the facts. It is too large by
far in most years. In 1905, 1906 and probably 1901 it is
too small. It does not vary nearly enough. As V&acute; for
years other than 1909 and 1896 is determined, for Professor
Fisher's equation, by dividing the M&acute;V&acute; thus estimated
by the M&acute; for the year, it is clear that V&acute; as estimated
by Professor Fisher is very much less variable than it is in
fact. It is pretty variable even in his figures, but his
figures do not nearly show how variable it is.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Again, this undue weighting of country clearings, swallowing
up New York, vitiates Professor Fisher's estimates
for V, the velocity of money, for years other than 1909 and
1896. One of the elements in the calculation of V is the
estimated V&acute;.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> Since V&acute; is wrong, V will also be wrong.
V is probably much more variable than Professor Fisher's
figures would indicate. With great admiration for the
ingenuity of Professor Fisher's speculations regarding V, I
find too many elements of conjecture, and too many arbitrary
assumptions, to give me confidence in the figure for
any year. I refrain from going into any general criticism
of his method of calculating V, however, contenting myself
with the one clear point that, to the extent that the values
of V for years other than 1909 and 1896 depend on the
estimated M&acute;V&acute; for those years, they are less variable than
they ought to be.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p>The same conclusion regarding Professor Fisher's estimates
for V&acute; have been reached, by a different method, by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
Professor Wesley C. Mitchell. He, too, concludes that V&acute;
is, in fact, more variable than Professor Fisher would indicate.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>I conclude, therefore, that neither V&acute; nor V has been
correctly calculated, for years other than 1909 and 1896. I
pass now to a consideration of T, the volume of trade, after
which I shall consider P, the price-level, in the equation of
exchange.</p>

<p>Let us first recall the point made in the chapter on "The
Equation of Exchange," that P and T, the price-level and
the volume of trade, are not independent even in idea. If
one is given an independent definition, the other cannot
be given an independent definition. If the equation is to
be true, then P must be weighted by the numbers of each
item (as hats) exchanged. P is not a mere average, but is
a <i>weighted</i> average, and T is always the denominator in the
formula for P. In developing statistics for P and T, therefore,
this fact must be kept in mind, and the elements
entering into each must coincide, and vary together year
by year.</p>

<p>In our chapter on "The Volume of Money and the Volume
of Trade," we showed that the great bulk of trade is
speculation. We showed that the <i>indicia</i> of variation
which Fisher<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> and Kemmerer have constructed for trade,
dominated by inflexible physical items of consumption
and production, give wholly misleading results for every
year except the base year. They give a steadily growing,
inflexible figure, with little variation from its steady path.
Trade, if chiefly speculation, is highly flexible, varies
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
enormously from year to year, waxes and wanes. This
point need not be further developed. At best Fisher's
figure for trade can be accepted only for one year, 1909.</p>

<p>Is, however, the figure for 1909, 387 billions, an acceptable
figure? Is it not decidedly too large? It is made up,
it will be recalled, by taking the figures for MV and M&acute;V&acute;,
adding them together to get one side of the equation, and
declaring them equal to PT. P is then declared to be $1,
by the arbitrary device of taking as the unit of T one
dollar's worth of every sort of good at the prices of 1909.
T is, then, 387 billions, since MV plus M&acute;V&acute; equals 387
billions. The theory underlying this is that deposits made
in banks correctly represent trade.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Our criticisms as to
the absolute magnitude assigned to T (and hence to MV
plus M&acute;V&acute;) will rest in large measure in challenging this
assumption. It is our contention<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> that deposits made in
banks very greatly overcount trade.</p>

<p>Deposits made in banks include taxes and other public
revenues; they include loans and repayments, and interest-payments;
they include gifts and benevolences, money sent
by parents to children away from home, pensions, payments
of insurance losses, annuities, dividends on stocks,
payments to and from savings and loan associations, fines,
contributions to churches, and other non-commercial
organizations, etc., etc. None of this represents trade.</p>

<p>But further, whether payments are in trade or not, many
times indeed does it happen that several checks are drawn
in connection with the same transaction. Professor Kemmerer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
entertaining this possibility, thought it might be
neutralized by cases where the same check passes through
several hands, making payments in several different transactions.
He calls this, however, a "gratuitous assumption
of unverifiable accuracy,"<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> and makes no claim to have
given the matter careful study.</p>

<p>In general, I think it safe to hold that the case where a
single check passes through several hands is not important.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
It will happen chiefly with small checks in small places, or
with small checks paid to laborers. It is the pecuniary
magnitude of checks, rather than their number, that counts
here. I am informed by several bankers that large checks
are almost universally deposited at once. This is for several
reasons: (1) The recipient of the check wishes to make
sure that it is good. (2) It is unlikely that the check is of
the right size for another transaction, unless the recipient
is a mere agent for a third party, in which case he should
(but commonly does not) pass it on to his principal, if
double counting is to be avoided. (3) Every person who
handles sums of any size wishes a record of the transaction,
and his own canceled check is a receipt which he would not
have if he passed on the check of another.</p>

<p>This last point will go far toward explaining why bank
transactions may multiply without a corresponding multiplication
of trade. The banks do the bookkeeping for
modern business in increasing degree. Checks are records,
of high legal value. A colleague recently told me that he,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
in his own capacity, had just drawn a check to himself,
as trustee, transferring a sum from one account to another.
Another colleague, with eight different bank accounts,
estimates that over 50% of the deposits in three of them
represent transfers from other accounts. This kind of
duplication, where trust relations are involved, is enormous.
Intercorporate relations and separate bank accounts within
a corporation complicate it still further.</p>

<p>A check is drawn by a subsidiary corporation to its dividend
account, and deposited; a check on this dividend
account<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> is then deposited in the general account of the
parent corporation; a third deposit, of the same funds, is
then made in the dividend account of the parent corporation;
a fourth deposit of the same funds is made in a trust
fund which holds stock in the parent corporation; a fifth
deposit in the personal account of the beneficiary of the
trust fund; a sixth deposit may be made of a check on this
fund in the personal account of the beneficiary's wife.
The first three of these deposits, at least, will be made of
the total dividend of the subsidiary corporation. <i>Not one</i>
of these six deposits represents <i>trade</i>. Payments of wages
and rents should count as trade, but payments of interest
and dividends stand on a separate footing. When a man
has bought a stock or a bond, he has already bought all the
income which is to come from them, and to count the interest
and dividends as separate items is double counting.
They are <i>payments</i>, but not <i>trade</i>. Even if the dividend
payment be counted as trade, however, it is counted <i>six</i>
times.</p>

<p>There is enormous overcounting as a consequence of the
combinations of corporations, each of which retains its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
own numerous bank accounts. The Interstate Commerce
Commission calls attention to great duplications from this
cause in connection with railway income accounts.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Even
within single corporations the duplications<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> are very great.
Thus, the local agent of a railroad deposits his receipts in a
local bank. His check, or, more usually, the draft of the
bank, is subsequently deposited in a bank at headquarters.
Subsequent disbursements, in places away from headquarters,
particularly of wages, will frequently be preceded
by deposits in other local banks. This duplication will be
true of telegraph, telephone, insurance and other companies
which have scattered agencies, including the wholesale
trade. Advertising agencies will illustrate it. <i>All</i> checks
between agent and principal, customer and broker, etc.,
will illustrate it. There is a great deal of double counting
in stock transactions from this source. Thus, a Boston
broker takes orders, with a check for margin, for execution
in New York. The order is executed by a New York
broker, who deals with another New York broker, who
represents a Louisville broker, who represents a Louisville
client. Now to the extent that any checks at all pass between
the Boston broker and his client, the Boston broker
and the New York broker, the other New York broker and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
the Louisville broker, or the Louisville broker and his client,
we have overcounting. Only the check between the two
New York brokers is properly counted. It is, of course,
well known that a small percentage of the dealings of a
customer of a brokerage house is represented by checks
between broker and customer. Professor Fisher states this
to be about 5%.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> It is, however, 5% of overcounting!
Moreover, through keeping "open accounts," with irregular
settlements of "margins" only, the Boston broker and
the New York broker reduce markedly the checks passing
between them. There is a back and forth flow of items
which in large degree cancel one another, since the Boston
broker sells in New York as well as buys there, and the New
York broker, to a less degree, both buys and sells Boston
securities, through his Boston correspondent. But not all
by any means is canceled, and <i>all</i> the checks that pass in
this way represent double counting. The total is large.</p>

<p><i>Public funds</i> are included in the deposits reported to
Kinley. Taxes are not <i>trade</i>. Double, triple and multiple
counting comes as revenues are received by local authorities,
transferred to State accounts, subsequently redistributed
to local accounts, or to the treasurers of State institutions,
transferred from one bank to another, etc. The
State of Massachusetts scatters its deposits in banks all
over the State, and makes transfers from one account to
another. The City of Boston has many bank accounts.
The Federal Treasury deals largely with banks over the
country.</p>

<p>Whenever a retail store has branches, duplications are
likely to occur. "Chain stores" make great overcounting.
"Kiting" swells bank deposits.</p>

<p>Replying to these contentions, Professor Fisher has urged
that there is large <i>undercounting</i>, also, and that the under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>counting
balances the overcounting. I have myself called
attention to a good deal of undercounting in the chapter on
"Barter." A substantial amount of ordinary trade is
carried on by means of partially offsetting book-credit, time
bills of exchange, simple barter, etc. The amount might
even run high, as compared with ordinary trade, when the
clearing arrangements in the stock and produce exchanges
are taken into account. But it is impossible to figure out
anything at all in this line which is to be compared with
the great gap between the 141 billions of trade we were able
to find,<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and the 387 billions Professor Fisher assigns to
trade. The gap of over 245 billions is much too great.
Besides, in our 141 billions, we have counted barter items,
book-credit items, time-bill of exchange items, etc., already.</p>

<p>The main item of undercounting must be in connection
with the clearing arrangements in the speculative exchanges.
This would seem to be Professor Fisher's view, as well.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a>
Data are at hand for the two great exchanges of the country
which enable us to measure, with some precision, the
amount of the undercounting&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, to tell the extent to
which checks are dispensed with in the trading of these two
great exchanges. The two exchanges are the Chicago
Board of Trade and the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>For the New York Stock Exchange, figures are taken
from Pratt's <i>Work of Wall Street</i>, 1912 ed., pp. 166-167,
180, 273. The figures are for the big year, 1901, when 266
million shares were sold, more than in 1909 by 51 millions
of shares, and when the Stock Exchange Clearing House
should have done better, in the magnitude of the undercounting,
than it did in 1909. Figures since 1901 are,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
Pratt states,<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> not available. Pratt also gives figures for
1893, but does not give data as to the percentage of stocks
handled by the Clearing House, so that comparison with
the 1901 figures cannot be made.</p>

<p>In 1901, 265,944,659 shares were sold. Of these, 15%
were "X-Clearing House," <i>i. e.</i>, not on the list of stocks
handled through the Stock Exchange Clearing House.
This 15% was paid for in full by check. The bond sales
are not cleared, and so another billion dollars of checks is
required for this item.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> If we assume (on the basis of the
estimates given to the writer by DeCoppet &amp; Doremus, and
Mr. Byron W. Holt, for recent years) that 25% of the 100
share sales would be added if "odd lots" were counted, we
have another large item that does not go to the Clearing
House. "Private clearings" reduce the number of checks
in connection with odd lots, but not so effectively as is the
case with hundred share sales put through the Clearing
House. So far the Clearing House has done nothing. What
did it do with the 85% of the stocks in hundred share lots
offered for clearing?</p>

<p>The figures are perfectly definite. The 85% of the 266
million shares sold was 226 million shares. The "share
balance" remaining after the Clearing House had done its
best was 134 million shares.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> The number of shares sold,
then, for which checks did not have to pass as a result of
the clearing process was 93 millions. In terms of dollars,
we may put the same figures. The estimated money-value
of the 266 million shares sold was 20.5 billions;<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> 85% of
this is 17,425 millions. The certifications required to pay
for the 134 million share balance was 10,930 millions. The
saving in checks was, thus, 6,495 millions of dollars. This
is the full extent to which the Stock Exchange Clearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
House undercounts recorded share sales. This is less than
1.7% of Professor Fisher's 387 billions! To offset this,
however, we have <i>over</i>counting in the 5% of checks for all
dealings on the Exchange which pass between brokers and
customers, as shown, and all the checks between brokers
and out-of-town brokers. We shall also find items of <i>over</i>counting
which vastly more than offset this undercounting,
in <i>loan</i> transactions between brokers, and between banks
and brokers, to which we shall shortly give attention.</p>

<p>This six and a half billions in checks saved on account of
sales of stocks is no small matter, absolutely. But this,
though measuring the extent of undercounted <i>sales</i>, by no
means measures the services of the Clearing House to the
Stock Exchange. Not merely stocks <i>sold</i> have to be
cleared. Stocks <i>borrowed</i> are also cleared. Borrowing of
stocks is not <i>trade</i>, but borrowing of stocks requires the
passage of money and checks. When stocks are borrowed,
money is <i>loaned</i>. A bear sells short. He has to deliver
next day. He accomplishes this by having his broker
"borrow" the stock he needs from a broker representing a
bull, who is long on the stocks, and who needs money to
"carry" them. The bull, who lends the stock, receives
dividends from the bear, as they accrue, and pays the bear
interest on the money lent. An enormous lot of this takes
place. Moreover, to some extent, these transactions are
increased artificially, in order that the broker may make
his "clearing sheet" misleading, and avoid revealing his
position with reference to the market.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> Loans of stock and
sales of stock appear alike in the transactions of the Clearing
House. Moreover, apart from the necessities of the
bears for stocks to deliver, we have the necessities of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
bulls for money to carry their stocks. If a broker who has
borrowed largely from the banks finds his customers turning
to the bear side of the market, he has an excess of funds.
He may repay his loans, but they may be, in part, time
loans, and in any case, he may find it just as well, if he can
make a small fraction of 1% in interest, to lend to another
broker, among whose customers the bulls are increasing.
A vast deal of money is thus transferred, on collateral
security, by means of "loaning stocks." Brokers prefer
to borrow money from one another in this manner, since no
margins are required, in general, whereas banks would require
margins. These various reasons make a vast deal
of "borrowing and carrying" transactions, and a regular
place is set aside for them on the Floor&mdash;Post 4, commonly
called the "Money Post." At this post, also, the banks,
through brokers, lend on call, and the published call rates
are established there. Of this, however, we shall have
more to say later.</p>

<p>The extent to which this loaning of stocks takes place
at the "Money Post," as compared with the loaning done
privately, varies. It makes no difference, however, from
the standpoint of the volume of these transactions that go
to the Clearing House whether they are put through at the
"Money Post" or outside. The loans made by the <i>banks</i> at
the "Money Post" do not affect the Stock Exchange Clearing
House totals.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Formerly the "Money Post" was a place
where the position of the bears could be gauged in a given
stock. If the demand for a stock was great, the bulls could
take heart, and increase the pressure. To avoid giving
away this information, however, borrowing is done on a
large scale privately, at present.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> Of course, if the pressure
gets too strong, it will manifest itself at the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
post anyhow, since bears borrowing particular stocks will
forego all or part of the interest, or even pay a premium
for the stock.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a></p>

<p>Now it is possible, from the figures given for the total
clearings of the Stock Exchange Clearing House, in conjunction
with the figures of recorded sales, and the percentage
of "X-Clearing House" sales, to get a fairly accurate
idea of the magnitude of these stock borrowing operations
between brokers. The total number of shares offered for
clearing by "both sides" in 1901 was 926,347,300! This is
double the actual amount, since both buyer and seller report
the same transaction to the Clearing House, the former with
a "receive from" sheet, and the latter with a "deliver to"
sheet. Half this amount, or 463,173,650 shares, represents
the actual number of shares to be handled. As we have
seen, 226 millions of this (85% of the recorded sales of 266
millions) represents sales. The rest, or 237,173,650,
represents borrowing of stocks.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> Borrowing exceeds actual
sales, if the figures for 1901&mdash;a year of enormous sales<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>&mdash;are
representative. We have, now, an explanation of
the prevailing opinion among brokers that the Stock Exchange
Clearing House dispenses with the major part of
the checks that would otherwise be required. <i>For their
purposes</i>, it does make a vast difference. Pratt's figures<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a>
show that, without the Clearing House, certifications of
$27,995,896,400 would have been required; that certifications
of $17,065,042,800 were obviated<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> by the Clearing
House, leaving the balance of $10,930,853,600 of certifications
which had to be used. This balance, as we have seen,
is the major portion of what would have had to be paid
anyhow for the stocks actually sold and offered for clearing.
The saving on the actual sales is only 6.5 billions.
But the saving to the brokers was, of course, much greater.
Even six and a half billions is no slight matter for any purpose
except the explanation of our 245 surplus billions!
Pratt gives an estimate at another place of the certifications
required by the Stock Exchange sales, reaching virtually
the same conclusion that we have reached by a somewhat
different combination of his figures. He indicates that 14
billions of certifications were required, counting in the
bonds, in 1901.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> This compares with the 20.5 billions
estimated value of stocks sold, and approximately one
billion of bonds. This leaves 7.5 billions of certifications
obviated on sales. This takes no account of the "odd
lots." If they run to an additional 25%, we have five<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
billions more which are not put through the Clearing House.
My information is, however, that "private clearings" reduce
the checks in connection with these, though not so
efficiently as is the case with the big Clearing House.</p>

<p>Do the figures that get into the "all other" deposits
from those connected with the Stock Exchange undercount
sales made there? Not yet have we taken account
of an item which swamps all that we have considered. I
refer to loan transactions by the banks, particularly call
loans. The volume of these is enormous. At the "Money
Post" alone, the figures average between 20 millions and
25 millions a day.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> The range is from 10 to 50 millions.
The major part of these loans are not made on the Floor of
the Exchange, however, but privately, between banks and
brokers. Even on the Floor, no records of the loans are
kept, and only estimates are available. For the loans made
privately, no figures are attainable at all. The total must
be enormous. One authority writes, in a letter, "The total
amount of money loaned at the post varies considerably,
depending upon the rate. For instance, when money is
under 3%, loans are largely made directly between the
banks and the brokers, but when it gets over 3% and gets
strong, more loans are made at the post. Some national
banks make all their loans there right along, so I understand."
My information from an officer of the National
City Bank is that it lends the major part of its demand
money on the floor of the Exchange. The other chief
lenders, according to the Pujo Report,<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> are the National
Bank of Commerce, The Chase National, the Hanover
National, J. P. Morgan and Co., and Kuhn-Loeb. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
same report states that the bulk of such loans are made
directly between banks and brokers, and not at the "Money
Post."</p>

<p>How do these transactions affect Kinley's figures for
deposits, and so Fisher's total of 387 billions? The small
dealer deals, usually, with one bank. When he borrows,
he gets a "credit" on his deposit account, but makes no
"deposit" that would get into Kinley's figures. But stockbrokers
deal with many banks. They have one bank which
"certifies" for them, and with which they regularly keep
a "balance." But for their loans, they deal with whatever
bank gives them the best rate, or has the funds to spare.
In time of tight money, they shift their loans with great
frequency. They borrow also from one another. "Money"
is "worth money" in New York, and idle funds will be
lent by whomever has them for whatever the market will
pay, on collateral security on call. When a broker deposits
money in his bank borrowed from another bank or another
broker, he gets a deposit credit which does get into Kinley's
figures&mdash;he deposits a certified check, or a bank draft.
The following has been described as a typical transaction
by the bond expert of a Boston banking house, and has been
amplified by several Wall Street men with whom I have
discussed it. A, whose home bank is Bank W, has borrowed,
on call, $500,000 from Bank X. Bank X calls the loan.
A finds Bank Y willing to lend him enough to pay it off.
Before he can get the new loan from Bank Y, however,
he must get his collateral released by Bank X. Before he
can do that, he must pay off the loan at Bank X. His
recourse, then, is to Bank W, his regular bank, which certifies
for him, and with which he keeps his balance. Bank
W gives him a certified check (either an overcertification,
or a "morning loan" transaction), for $500,000, with which
he pays off the loan at Bank X. He then takes the col<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>lateral
from Bank X to Bank Y, and makes a new loan.
He gets a draft from Bank Y, which he deposits with Bank
W, and then draws another check against his deposit with
Bank W to pay off the "morning loan," in case the transaction
took that form. Here are three checks for this loan
transaction, two of which get into clearings, and one of
which gets into "all other deposits." But the checks may
be multiplied. A, instead of getting a new loan at Bank
Y, may call a loan from broker B, who may then call a loan
from broker C, who may go to Bank Y to get the funds he
needs to pay B. Here are two new checks in the series,
both of which get into the "all other" deposits. Checks
fly about recklessly in Wall Street, and men will turn
over money many times, if an eighth of 1%, or less, can
stick by the way, on a good sum, for a few days! This is
strikingly illustrated by a fact which caught my attention
in the monthly bank statement of a brokerage house which
I was allowed to examine. The deposits made during the
month, and the checks drawn during the month, balanced
to within five hundred and fifty dollars out of several millions.
The broker said of this: "It would be true even for a
single day, and it would be true for a year. The bank requires
us to keep a minimum balance; it is to our interest
not to keep more than that. If we have more at the end of
the day, we lend it out; if we have less, we borrow to make
up the deficiency. We try to have just that balance, and
no more, to our credit at the bank at the end of every day."
The handling of funds by a brokerage house is a fine art,
involving both technical skill and a philosophic grasp of the
factors of the "money market." Are rates going up?
Then it is well to reduce call loans, and borrow more on
time. If lower rates are anticipated, more call money will
be employed&mdash;with the possibility of a "squeeze" if too
much is taken that way. Hidden dangers must be foreseen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
The sums borrowed are enormous, and brokers' profits
depend in very substantial degree on their skill in borrowing
as cheaply as possible, and in utilizing their funds to the utmost.</p>

<p>It is here, I think, in loan transactions between banks and
brokers and between brokers, that we have a major part
of the explanation of the huge deposit figures for New York
City, and for the tremendous influence of stock sales on
clearings, which Mr. Silberling's<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> figures show. This is
the opinion of Professor O. M. W. Sprague, who first called
my attention to the volume of call loans, and rapid shifting
of call loans, in New York, and it is the opinion of every
Wall Street man with whom I have discussed the matter.
The actual pecuniary magnitude of the share sales and
bond sales is not enough to do it. The mass of connected
loan transactions, however, substantially greater in volume
than the actual sales of securities, is, with the security
sales, enough to do it.</p>

<p>When the call rate is high, which will particularly happen
when bank reserves are low, the shifting in loans will be
much increased. One bank will have money to lend one
day, but the next day will have to call it, to meet heavy
demands at the Clearing House, while some other bank
will have the surplus funds to lend. The brokers, by bidding
up the rate, will tempt the temporary lending even
of small surpluses, if their necessities are great. The
volume of "all other deposits" and of bank clearings will
be swelled by this much beyond ordinary. That this
should not be revealed to ordinary statistical tests is due
to the fact that speculation tends to fall off at such a time,
so that the other factors in the stock exchange operations
tend to reduce daily deposits and bank clearings. Mr.
Silberling has applied to this problem the technique of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
refinement of the correlation method, the method of partial
correlation, with the result of confirming this view.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p>

<p>I conclude, therefore, that stock exchange transactions,
instead of being undercounted in bank deposits, are very
greatly overcounted.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> The big item that does it is loan
transactions between brokers and brokers and between
brokers and banks.</p>

<p>The evidence from the Chicago Board of Trade, with
reference to the extent of clearings within the exchange
there, comes in a letter from the Secretary of the Board of
Trade to Professor Taussig. The only clearing house trans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>actions
are in connection with "futures." All "spot"
transactions are paid in full by check. All futures other
than those offset by clearing are paid in full by check. The
total amount put through the Clearing House in 1915 was
118 millions, of which the balances paid were 41 millions
(saving checks to the extent of 77 millions). This 77 millions
is a trifle indeed as compared with the gap of 245 billions
we are trying to fill! It is a trifle also as compared
with the business done on the Board of Trade. The Secretary
estimates that commodities to the value of $375,000,000
actually arrived on the exchange in 1915. On the average,
the figure would be $350,000,000. For the Stock
Yards "it is approximately the same&mdash;last year was
$375,000,000. Of fruits, vegetables, poultry, butter, eggs,
etc., sold in South Water Street, it is claimed by their statisticians,
the value is $350,000,000, or a total of about
eleven hundred millions <i>arriving</i> [Italics mine] yearly at
this great market place, all of which is paid for by checks,
and when the ownership changes, the change of ownership
is always paid by check." How many times the goods
change hands, cannot be stated on the basis of records
of the Board of Trade. The Secretary contents himself
with saying that they are "sold and resold many times."
We have discussed this, on the basis of reputed figures of
the Federal tax on grain futures in 1915, in our chapter on
"Volume of Money and Volume of Trade." In any case,
it is clear that the 77 millions of checks economized, though
absolutely great, is relatively a bagatelle. It is, moreover,
more than compensated for by loan transactions. The
Secretary estimates that for a sixty-day period, when grain
is coming in, from two to four millions will be lent by the
banks daily on <i>arriving</i> grain. How great the loan transactions
on subsequent sales will be we can only conjecture.</p>

<p>While able to find, then, important cases of trade and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
speculation which dispense with the use of checks, I cannot
find anything of magnitude sufficient to aid Professor Fisher's
case, and I find, on the other hand, enormous overcounting
in every field where business and banks meet,
as well as in the relations of banks to non-commercial depositors.</p>

<p>I conclude, therefore, with reference to the figures of
Fisher and Kemmerer<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> for volume of trade, that they are
much exaggerated for the base year, and that for every
other year they are wholly wrong, both because of their
excessive magnitude, and because the index of variation
has been wrongly chosen.</p>

<p>The discussion of P, the price-level, in the statistics of
Kemmerer and Fisher need not be extended. P, for the
equation of exchange, and for the quantity theory, is a
<i>weighted</i> average, each price that goes into it being weighted
by the number of exchanges involving the commodity of
which it is the price. The weighting of P should correspond
to the elements in T, the volume of trade, and should vary
from year to year, as the elements in T change.<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> Now
Kemmerer's P is weighted as follows: wages, 3, security
prices, 8, wholesale prices, 89.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> If our conclusions with
reference to the composition of the volume of trade, as developed
in the chapter on "Volume of Money and Volume
of Trade," are valid, this weighting gives us a P which has
no relevance to the equation of exchange. The wholesale
items should have a weight of not more than one-sixth of
the total for 1909. Certain commodities, as wheat and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
cotton, in which there is heavy speculation, should be given
great weight, and securities should have, probably, the
greatest weight of all. If "trade" is to be extended to cover
transactions in bills of exchange and loan transactions (as
it is by Kemmerer),<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> then P should contain these things,
weighted more than all else put together, particularly if
call loans are included. The weights should be radically
altered from year to year. We should then get a P which
would fit the "equation of exchange"&mdash;though what else
it would be good for is hard to say! The same criticism
applies to Fisher's P. It is dominated by wholesale prices.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
It therefore has no relevance to an equation of exchange
in which only one-sixth at the very most of the items are
wholesale items. Neither Fisher nor Kemmerer alter their
weights in P at all, to correspond to yearly alterations in
the composition of T.</p>

<p>As <i>indicia</i> of changes in the <i>absolute value</i> of money,
Kemmerer's and Fisher's index numbers, or other index
numbers of numerous wholesale prices, with a substantial
weighting of wages, are probably better than an index
dominated by stocks. Stocks fluctuate more widely than
wholesale prices and wages, their values are more affected
by variations in business confidence, and by variations in
the rate of interest. For measuring <i>the value of money</i>,
the index numbers here criticised are very good. But for
the purpose for which they are chosen, namely, to fill the
equation of exchange, and to measure variations in a <i>price-level</i>
of the sort the quantity theory and the equation of
exchange are concerned with, they are simply irrelevant.
If it were really true that such an index number varied
with the quantity of money, then the quantity theory would
be effectively disproved!</p>

<p>Now, in general summary of our criticisms of the figures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
of Kemmerer and Fisher: they have systematically buried
New York City, and systematically covered up speculation.
All the errors converge in this direction. The <i>indicia</i> of
trade cover up speculation and the other things that go on
in New York, and other financial centers. The <i>indicia</i>
of prices do likewise. Fisher weights New York clearings
only 1, while weighting country clearings 5, in his index
of variation of check transactions. He also counts New
York returns for March 16, 1909, as complete, and gives
all of his estimate for non-reporting banks to the country.
Kemmerer does not do this, but he does exaggerate the importance
of money, as compared with checks, and does not
allow the velocity of money to vary at all in his figures,
thus getting a much greater constancy in the figure for total
circulation of money and checks than is proper, and covering
up the flexibility and variability which New York gives
to our system.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> In general, our task in this chapter has
been an arch&aelig;ological excavation&mdash;we have rediscovered
a buried city.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>

<h3>RECAPITULATION OF POSITIVE DOCTRINE</h3>


<p>The chapters which have gone before have been, in considerable
degree, concerned with the analysis of unsuccessful
efforts to solve the problem of the value of money, as
the quantity theory, or the attempts to apply the notions
of supply and demand, marginal utility, and cost of production,
to the problem. Not all that has gone before has
been, even in form, primarily critical. The chapter on
"Economic Value" lays the foundation for the main constructive
theory of the book, and in virtually every chapter
some portion of our positive doctrine has been developed.
In the doctrines criticised, elements of truth have been
noted, and in showing the errors of the doctrines considered,
constructive doctrine has been presented by way of contrast.
The theories criticised, moreover, even where they
have gone astray in solving problems, have at least the
merit of <i>stating</i> problems, and so have aided in clearing the
way for theories better based.</p>

<p>It is the task of the present chapter to present, in a series
of theses, the main constructive results so far attained. No
effort will be made to follow the order of the exposition which
has preceded. A summary of that will be found in the detailed
analytical table of contents. Rather, we shall seek
to draw from what has preceded the positive doctrine which
is scattered through the preceding chapters, and to present
it by itself, as a basis for the more systematic formulation
of constructive theory which the following chapters are to
contain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p>1. The theory of the value of money is a special case of
the general theory of value.</p>

<p>2. Value is a phenomenon of psychological nature. Not
physical quantities, but psychological significances, are
relevant when the problem of value and price causation is
involved.</p>

<p>3. Value is not a ratio of exchange, or "purchasing
power," but is an absolute quantity, prior to exchange.
It is the fundamental and essential attribute or quality of
wealth, the common or homogeneous element present amidst
the diversities of the physical forms of wealth, by virtue
of which comparisons may be instituted among different
kinds of wealth, and different items of wealth may be
added to make a sum, put into ratios of exchange, and
so on.</p>

<p>4. Economic value is a <i>species</i> of the <i>genus</i>, <i>social value</i>,
co&ouml;rdinate with legal value, and moral value. It is part
of a system of social motivation and control.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> Psychological
in character, it none the less presents itself to an individual
as an objective, external force, to which he must adapt
himself.</p>

<p>5. Individual prices have two co&ouml;perating causes: (a) the
social economic value of the money-unit, and (b) the social
economic value of the unit of the good in question.</p>

<p>6. The average of prices, or the "price-level," is a mere
mathematical summary of the particular prices. The causation
involved in the average of prices is nothing more than
the causation involved in the particular prices.</p>

<p>7. The value of money is to be distinguished from the
"reciprocal of the price-level," or the "purchasing power
of money." The value of money is an absolute quantity,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
one of the factors, determining each particular price. Particular
prices and general prices may change because of
changes in the values of goods, with no change in the value
of money. Or, particular prices and general prices may
change because of changes in the value of money, with
goods remaining constant in value.</p>

<p>8. The absolute value of money, assumed constant, is
presupposed by the great body of present day price theory,
as supply and demand, cost of production, and the capitalization
theory. These theories are, therefore, inapplicable
to the problem of the value of money.</p>

<p>9. But supply and demand, cost of production, the capitalization
theory, and other laws concerned with the concatenation
and interrelations of prices, being applicable to
the problem of particular prices, are also applicable to the
problem of general prices. (Chapter on "The Passiveness
of Prices.")</p>

<p>10. The general price-level, as a consequence of changes
in particular prices, growing out of changes in the values
of goods, may rise or fall, without antecedent changes in the
value of money, or the quantity of money, or the volume of
credit, or the volume of trade, or in the "velocities of circulation"
of money or credit. (Chapter on "The Passiveness
of Prices.")</p>

<p>11. The general laws of prices, supply and demand, cost
of production, the capitalization doctrine, the imputation
doctrine, etc., conflict with the quantity theory. In the
cases where they conflict, the first named doctrines are
correct, and the quantity theory is wrong. (Chapter on
"The Passiveness of Prices.")</p>

<p>12. The value of money, being a special case of economic
value, is subject to the same general laws. This means,
from the standpoint of my theory, that the theory of social
value is applicable to the problem of the value of money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>

<p>13. This is not the same as saying that the whole value
of money is to be explained by the social value of gold
bullion, conceived of as a mere commodity. A hypothetical
case was constructed in the chapter on "Dodo-Bones,"
in which gold is the standard of value, but is not employed
as a medium of exchange or in reserves, where the whole
value of money is to be explained by the value of gold
bullion, conceived of as a commodity.</p>

<p>14. But, in general, money gets part of its value from its
monetary employments. (Chapter on "Dodo-Bones.")</p>

<p>15. The additional value which comes to gold bullion
as a consequence of its employment as money, is itself to be
explained on social value principles. It grows out of the
social value of the services which money performs.</p>

<p>16. The functions of money remain to be examined in
detail. And the relation between the value of particular
services of money and the capital value of money, has not
yet been analyzed. There is a relation between the two&mdash;a
relation which varies under different conditions&mdash;even
though it has been shown in the chapter on the "Capitalization
Theory" that the relation is not the simple one
which holds between the values of services and the capital
value of ordinary income-bearers. There must be an increment
to the value of gold bullion as a consequence of its
being coined, however, since otherwise there would be no
force leading it to be coined.</p>

<p>17. This increment in value to bullion, as a consequence
of coinage, becomes evident when free coinage is suspended.
An agio of coin over uncoined bullion may easily appear.</p>

<p>18. But this is not to assert the doctrine of the quantity
theory. Because</p>

<p>19. The money service presupposes the existence of
value for money from some source other than the monetary
employment (chapter on "Dodo-Bones"); and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span></p>

<p>20. Hence the monetary employment can explain only a
differential portion of the value of money.</p>

<p>21. The proposition that money must have value from
some source other than the monetary employment does not
mean, necessarily, that money must be made of precious
metals, or be convertible into precious metals. The value
of money is, indeed, most stable and best sustained when
such is the case. But it is possible for money made of paper
to have value apart from the prospect of redemption&mdash;though
no clear case has been made, in the writer's opinion,
for the view that this has historically occurred. But as
a hypothetical possibility, my theory holds that paper
money may attain a value of its own, growing out of various
factors which a social psychology can explain, including
law, patriotism, and custom. Social values in every sphere
are imperfectly rationalized. Values which in their origin
are secondary and derived may become substantial and
independent of their "presuppositions." This is true of
legal and moral values. It is true of the capital value of
land. It may be true of paper money. This matter has
been discussed in the chapters on "Economic Value" and
on "Dodo-Bones." The social value theory has not the
limitations of the utility theory in dealing with such cases,
nor is it tied to a metallist or bullionist interpretation.
Legal, moral, and patriotic factors, and the influence of
social custom, all fall readily into the social value doctrine.</p>

<p>22. The "measure of values" function, and the "standard
of deferred payments" function, need not require the actual
use of money, and need not add to the value of money.
The function of "medium of exchange," and other functions
to be analyzed in a later chapter on that topic, do involve
the actual employment of money, and are sources of value
for money.</p>

<p>23. The quantity of money and credit are matters of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
high importance in economic life. They affect vitally the
smooth functioning of production and exchange. While
not accepting the extreme view of those writers who see
in scarcity or abundance of money the primary cause of
the ebb and flow of civilization, I maintain that the quantity
of money and credit does make a vast difference, and
that the quantity theory contention that, after a transition
is effected, the only consequence of a change in the quantity
of money is a proportional change in the price-level, is
wholly indefensible. (Chapter on "Volume of Money
and Volume of Trade.")</p>

<p>24. Very much of economic theory has been developed
in abstraction from money. For economic statics, with its
delicate marginal adjustments, on the assumption that
friction is banished, that the market is fluid, that labor
and capital and goods are mobile, etc., money does appear
a needless complication. But the static assumptions are
only possible because money and credit have smoothed the
way. It is the business, the function, of money and credit
to overcome "friction," to effect "transitions," to make it
possible for "normal" tendencies to manifest themselves.
(Chapter on "Volume of Money and Volume of Trade.")</p>

<p>25. The main work of money and credit is in effecting
"transitions," bringing about readjustments, enabling
society, with little shock, to adapt itself to dynamic change.
The great bulk of the actual exchanging that takes place
is speculation, and would not occur if economic life were in
static equilibrium. This is true both as a matter of theory
and as a matter of statistics. More than half of the checks
deposited in the United States are deposited in New York
City, where "wholesale" and "retail" deposits are a small
factor. Bank clearings fluctuate in close conformity with
stock exchange transactions. Great banks, and the bulk
of banking transactions, are everywhere found in the specu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>lative
centres. (Chapters on "Volume of Money and
Volume of Trade," and "The Rediscovery of a Buried
City.")</p>

<p>26. Hence a functional theory of money must be essentially
a dynamic theory: must rest in a study of "friction,"
"transitions," and the like. And,</p>

<p>27. Hence a theory of money like the quantity theory,
concerned with "long run tendencies" and "normal equilibria"
and "static adjustments" touches the real problem
of the value of money not at all.</p>

<p>28. An increase of money tends to increase trade. (Chapter
on "Volume of Money and Volume of Trade.")</p>

<p>29. An increase of credit tends to increase trade. (Same
chapter.)</p>

<p>30. An increase of trade tends to increase the volume of
credit, and, where the money supply is flexible, tends to
increase the money supply also. (Chapter on the "Volume
of Trade and the Volume of Money and Credit.")</p>

<p>31. Production waits on trade. The problem of marketing
in the modern world is often more important than the
problems of production in the narrower sense. Selling
costs are probably greater than strict "costs of production."
"Volume of trade," far from being dependent on "physical
capacities and technique," is almost indefinitely flexible,
with changing tone of the market, with changing values,
and with other changes, including changes in the volume
of money and credit. (Chapter on "Volume of Money
and Volume of Trade.")</p>

<p>32. The relation between the volume of money and the
volume of credit is exceedingly flexible. The relation between
the world's volume of credit and the world's volume
of gold is likewise exceedingly loose, uncertain, and flexible.
(Chapters on "Volume of Money and Volume of Credit,"
and "The Quantity Theory and World Prices.")<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>

<p>33. "Velocity of circulation" is a blanket name for a
complex and heterogenous set of activities of men. It is
a passive resultant of many causes, and is itself a cause of
nothing. The safest generalization possible concerning it
is that it varies with the volume of trade and with prices.</p>

<p>34. Barter remains an important factor in modern economic
life, and is a flexible substitute for the use of checks
and money, increasing when the money market "tightens."
It is greatly facilitated by the "common measure of values"
function of money.</p>

<p>35. The general criticism of the mechanistic scheme of
causation involved in the quantity theory has, as its positive
corollary, the doctrine that psychological explanations
must be given&mdash;that the phenomena are intricate and complex,
as intricate and complex as the play of human ideas
and emotions, and the network of social relationships.</p>

<p>36. This means that the theory of value, and of the value
of money, as here presented, cannot assume the simple
form, or the mathematical precision, which have made the
quantity theory so alluring. It means, further, that the
present study, as in part pioneer work, will lack finish and
definiteness in many places, will contain errors and gaps,
and will leave many problems unsolved, and many distinctions
undrawn. At many points, the analysis is confessedly
incomplete, and the problems imperfectly thought through&mdash;often
inadequately <i>stated</i>, if seen at all.</p>

<p>In what follows, these theses, with doctrines yet to be
developed, will be woven together into a systematic theory
of money and credit.</p>

<p>The study of the functions of money, in relation to its
value, will best be approached, I think, through a study
of the origin of money. In this, I shall base my conclusions
chiefly on the work of Karl Menger and W. W. Carlile,
who seem to me to have done most in this field.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span></p>

<p>On the basis of the general theory of value developed in
the first chapter, and the results of the two chapters which
are to follow on the origin and functions of money, I shall
reach my main conclusions as to the laws of the value of
money. On the basis of this theory of value, and of the
theory of the functions of money, I shall also try to develop
a psychological theory of credit, and to assimilate
credit phenomena to the general phenomena of value.
The development which the theory of credit has had, at the
hands of men whose chief interest was that of the jurist
or accountant, is valuable and important. I do not wish to
discredit what has been done. Many important doctrines
concerning credit have been developed. The general theory
of elastic bank-credit, worked out in the controversy between
the "Currency" and the "Banking" Schools, is of
the highest importance. This theory I have discussed in
the chapter on "The Volume of Trade and the Volume
of Money and Credit." I still feel, however, that there are
gaps in the prevailing ideas on credit which only a social
psychology can fill. I shall undertake to construe credit
as a part of the social system of motivation and control,
and to differentiate it from other parts of that system by an
analysis of its functions. I think, too, that the theory of
the relation of credit and money is in especially unsatisfactory
shape, particularly with reference to the factors
governing reserves.</p>

<p>A final chapter, in Part IV, will undertake to bring
together the various points in our discussion which deal
with the theory of prosperity, and will seek to bring the
notions of "theory of prosperity <i>vs.</i> theory of wealth,"
"statics <i>vs.</i> dynamics," "normal <i>vs.</i> transitional tendencies,"
and certain other similar contrasts, into a higher synthesis,
which will, to be sure, not rob these contrasts of
their significance, but will rather find certain generic prin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>ciples
which they share, and so make it possible to measure
considerations in one sphere in terms of considerations in
the other sphere. In very large degree, students of dynamics
and students of statics have been talking at cross-purposes,
missing the force of one another's arguments, and
have been quite unable, even when understanding one
another, to come to agreement, precisely because they have
lacked principles by means of which they could compare
in any quantitative way the forces which each studies.
A higher synthesis, which would give static and dynamic
theories common ground, would seem to be a desideratum
of high importance. Such a synthesis would go far toward
unifying the science of economics. I believe that the theory
of money and credit, approached from the angle of the
social value theory, will meet this need.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI</h3>

<h3>THE ORIGIN OF MONEY, AND THE VALUE OF GOLD</h3>


<p>This chapter is not concerned with history or anthropology
for their own sake. The present writer has made
no independent historical or anthropological researches, in
connection with the question of the origin of money. The
chapter is primarily concerned with giving an exposition
of the theories of two writers, Karl Menger and W. W.
Carlile.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> It is not important, for my purposes, whether
either writer has presented a theory which anthropology
will accept as a correct account of actual origins. The
theories do throw light on present functioning, and seem
to me to be correct as analytical theories, whether historically
adequate or not. There are two main questions with
which the chapter is concerned:</p>

<p>(1) How did money come to be?</p>

<p>(2) Why should gold and silver have passed all rival
commodities in the competition for employment as money?</p>

<p>Viewing these questions from the standpoint of present
functioning, rather than from the standpoint of historical
origins, we may restate them as follows:</p>

<p>(1) Why should men accept small disks of metal, or
paper representatives of these metal disks, for which, <i>as</i>
metal, they have no use, or at all events far in excess of the
amount which they can make use of as metal, in return for
economic commodities which they can use? The social
utility of a money economy may well be granted, without
giving an answer to this question. Granting that social<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
economic life works better by far when men do accept these
disks of metal in payments, the question still remains not
merely as to why the practice started, but also as to why
it continues. Granted that it is to the individual, as well
as to the social advantage, that each individual should
accept these metal disks in excess of his personal need
for the metal, <i>if he is assured that he can pass them on to
others at will</i> in return for the goods he wishes to consume,
the question still remains as to why the individual should
have this assurance, as to why the general practice should
continue. Menger quotes Savigny as holding that the
thing is downright "mysterious," and the Aristotelian
answer of social convention (sometimes interpreted as
"social contract") is, in effect, a confession that the thing
does baffle explanation on the ordinarily understood laws
of exchange. The convergence of individual and social
advantage, which English economic theory has done so
much to emphasize, is less clear by far in connection with
money than with the case where A trades a sheep (of which
he has a surplus) to B for a quantity of grain (of which B
has a surplus), while A has not enough grain, and B has not
enough sheep. This exchange is clearly to the advantage
of both A and B, and the practice of making such exchanges
is clearly to the general advantage. But in the case of
money, A trades sheep (of which he may not have an excess,
so far as his capacity to consume is concerned) for
disks of metal which he probably does not intend to consume
at all. The social advantage of a general practice of
the sort is easily established, but it is not clear that it is
to A's advantage, <i>unless we assume the practice general</i>.
But there are many practices which could be shown to be
socially advantageous if all men practiced them, and, indeed,
individually advantageous, if generally practiced,
which can, none the less, not be made a general practice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
If thieves would cease stealing, we could dispense with a
vast expense now incurred in police and safe deposit vaults
and heavy locks, etc., and with a small fraction of the
savings could give pensions to the thieves which would surpass
by far their present incomes! Individual and social
advantage would converge. But for many reasons the
practice could not be instituted, and would break down
quickly if instituted. Very powerful social pressure indeed
is needed to make an advantageous social institution&mdash;like
morality&mdash;work, so long as individuals sometimes find advantage
in breaking the general practice, even though the
general practice, <i>on the part of other people</i>, is of advantage
to every individual. Now it is clear that the institution
of money is to the social advantage. It is clear that it is
to the advantage of every individual who has money that
everyone else should be ready to accept it in unlimited
amount, in return for his goods and services. But it is not
clear, on the surface, why everyone should be ready to take
metal disks in unlimited amount in return for goods and
services. People will not take coal or horses or hay or land
or white elephants in unlimited amount in return for goods
and services. Why should there be such a general practice
regarding metal disks or pieces of paper?</p>

<p>This question, to one who has always lived in a money
economy, may seem childish. Such questions regarding
anything to which we have grown accustomed seem childish
to those who have not been used to raising them. Why does
the sun rise? Why does seed-corn sprout? But these also
are proper scientific questions, the answer to which is of
high practical importance! The answer to the question
just raised regarding money will go far toward explaining
the functions of money, and the theory of the functions of
money, together with the general theory of social value,
will give an answer to the question as to <i>how the money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
function adds to the value of money</i>. The answer which I
shall give on the first question will in large measure follow
the lines laid down by Menger.</p>

<p>(2) The second question needs little revision, when stated
from the standpoint of present functioning, rather than of
historical origin. We have more recent history to deal with
in connection with this question, and Carlile, in his answer,
offers substantial historical and anthropological proofs.
It is still, however, present functioning that is important,
and the question may be restated thus:</p>

<p>Why are gold and silver, and particularly gold, the standard
money of the great part of the world to-day? The
principles of social psychology which Carlile employs in
explaining the historical development, are also important
in explaining the present attitude of mankind toward gold
and silver, and will serve, together with the general theory
of social value, to answer the question as to the value which
money receives from the employment of the money metal
<i>as a commodity</i>.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note that neither of these questions has
been seriously raised or discussed by most recent writers
of the quantity theory type. Professors Kemmerer<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> and
Fisher give no attention to them at all. Both assume money
as circulating, as the starting point of the argument, without
noticing how much is involved in the assumption.
Neither, moreover, gives an <i>analysis</i> of the functions of
money. Considerations drawn from the question as to the
origin and functions of money are hard to bring into the
quantity theory scheme. If money circulates, there are
causes for it. Fully to understand those causes, would
be to understand also the <i>terms</i> on which money circulates,
that is to say, the <i>prices</i>. But then a quantity theory would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
be superfluous! And if the quantity theory answer should
not be obviously in harmony with the answer already given
by the theory of origin and functions, then doubt would
be cast on the quantity theory explanation. The quantity
theorists do well to avoid mixing up with their discussion
considerations drawn from the general theory of value,
and from the theory of the origin and functions of money.</p>

<p>The answer to the first question rests primarily in the
fact that there are differences in the <i>saleability</i> of goods.
Value and saleability are not the same thing. A copper
cent has high saleability; a farm has low saleability.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> Some
valuable things cannot be exchanged at all. The Capitol
at Washington cannot be exchanged, yet has value. Under
a communistic or socialistic r&eacute;gime, exchange, as we now
know it, would largely or wholly cease. An entailed estate
cannot be sold, yet has value. If society should really
come to the stable equilibrium of the "static state," most
of the exchanges of lands,<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> securities, and other long-time
income-bearers would cease, but they would still be valuable.
I have developed these notions in my article on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
"Value" in the <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>, Aug. 1915,
and have referred to them again in the chapter on "Value"
in the present book, and so need not expand the discussion
here. Exchangeability and value are different characteristics
of goods. Value is an essential precondition of exchangeability,
but can exist without it. Value is, however,
commonly increased by exchangeability. But the theory
of exchangeability is a separate matter, and cannot be deduced
from the theory of value alone.</p>

<p>Menger points out the difference between "buying
price" and "selling price." You can buy a piano for $400.
If you try the next minute to sell it for $375 you will probably
fail. You may pay ten thousand dollars for a farm.
The income of the farm may increase. The tax assessment
may increase. The capital value of the farm may increase.
And yet, you may have to wait for a long time before you
find a buyer who will pay you ten thousand dollars for it.
One buys pianos or farms, as a rule, only when one wishes
to use them, or when one has such special knowledge of the
market that one knows pretty definitely where purchasers
can be found for a resale, at a profit. Even in such highly
organized markets as the stock and produce exchanges, one
cannot usually buy in quantity and sell immediately without
some loss. "Buying price" and "selling price" of such
a stock as Industrial Alcohol Preferred are sometimes five
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>points apart, at a given time. The forced sale of land in
bankruptcies, or for taxes, notoriously often bring prices
far below the price which would correctly express the value
of the land. It is only in the ideal fluid market assumed by
static theory, where adjustments are instantaneous, where
causal-temporal relations have become timeless logical relations,
that values are perfectly expressed in prices.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>All these difficulties were enormously greater in days of
primitive barter, before money and organized markets had
been evolved. The difficulties of barter have been much
elaborated in the literature of money. I shall recur to the
topic in my chapter on the "Functions of Money." Part of
the trouble arises from the "want of coincidence" in barter&mdash;the
failure to find the man who has what you want, and who
at the same time wants what you have. Goods have high
or low saleability, depending, in considerable degree, on the
<i>universality</i> of the desire for them. They may have high
<i>value</i> if only a few rich men desire them, provided they be
scarce. The paintings of old masters would be a case in
point. Incidentally, the difference between buying price
and selling price is often enormous in this case, and the
making of a sale may well involve long and expensive
negotiations. The difficulties of exchange here arise not
alone from the limited market, however, but also from the
fact that each painting is a unique, and a unique of high
value. A good might have high saleability despite the
fact that the ultimate demand for it comes from only a few
rich men, if it could be easily subdivided and standardized.</p>

<p>Menger enumerates a number of circumstances connected
with a good which increase its saleability. Among them
are the following:</p>

<p>1. Widespread and intense desire for the thing (to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
should be added, adequate wealth on the part of those who
desire it).</p>

<p>2. Scarcity of the commodity in question.</p>

<p>3. Divisibility of the commodity.</p>

<p>4. Considerable development of the market.</p>

<p>5. That the demand for the article should be more than
local.</p>

<p>6. That it be cheaply transportable.</p>

<p>7. That commerce between localities in the article be
unrestricted.</p>

<p>8. That demand for the article be constant, not fluctuating,
in time.</p>

<p>9. That the article be durable.</p>

<p>10. That it be uniform in quality, so that standardization
is easy.</p>

<p>In general, Menger's list meets the requirements often
laid down for a good <i>medium of exchange</i>. In general, to
the extent that any commodity meets these tests, it will
be <i>saleable</i>. Commodities will vary indefinitely in the extent
of their saleability.</p>

<p>Starting with the distinction between value and saleability,
and with the analysis of the circumstances affecting
saleability, we may now undertake to see how money tends
to develop out of a barter economy. Suppose that a man,
in a barter economy, has a good of low saleability, which
he wishes to trade for some other specified commodity.
He finds no one who possesses the commodity he wants who
is willing to trade with him. But if he can trade his article
of low saleability for some other commodity of higher
saleability, <i>still not the thing he wants</i>, he has yet made
progress, he has got <i>one step nearer</i> the object which he
does want. It will be possible now, perhaps, to trade the
new article, of higher saleability, for the commodity he
wants. If not, he can trade it for some article of still higher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
saleability, which he can finally trade for the article he
wants. By several indirect exchanges, he finally reaches
his object. Incidentally, it is erroneous to distinguish
money and barter economies as economies based on direct
and indirect exchange. The barter economy may well involve
much more indirection than the money economy, in
many cases.</p>

<p>If there be in the market some one commodity which has
a conspicuously higher degree of saleability than any other,
the more sagacious men in the market will make it a point
to get hold of it and accumulate it in excess of their anticipated
consumption of it. They will do this, because they
will see that they can thereby get other things which they
do need more easily than in other ways. With the accumulation
of a given kind of highly saleable goods, in excess,
by a few men in the group, in the expectation that the surplus
will subsequently be used to buy other goods,&mdash;as yet
perhaps not specifically determined&mdash;we have, not money,
but a big step toward money. At first only a few grasp the
great idea. They succeed and become wealthy. Then others
see the advantage of the thing, and imitate them. The
prestige of the wealthy and successful men would induce
imitation even if the advantage were not clearly seen.
Then a tradition and a custom grows up. With the growth
of tradition and custom, picking out one or a small number
of things as particularly desirable objects to accumulate
because of their saleability, with the practice of accumulating
these articles in excess of intended consumption,
money becomes an accomplished fact. There is
no need for agreement or legislation. Money is not, in
its origin, certainly, a matter of law or conscious public
planning.</p>

<p>With the development of a highly saleable article into
money, moreover, we have further a great increase in that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
saleability itself. The quality which made the practice
possible becomes greatly enhanced by the practice. Menger
thinks that this leads to an absolute difference between
money and goods, the money article, which formerly was
merely superior to other goods in saleability, now becomes
absolutely saleable. The absoluteness of this distinction,
which would make it a distinction in kind, rather than in
degree, seems to me not to be sound. I think that the distinction
remains a distinction of degree. For one thing,
the development of money, while it adds to the saleability
of the money-commodity, <i>also adds to the saleability of other
goods</i>. <i>Two</i> things must be exchanged, in order that <i>one</i>
may be! It is the business of money to facilitate exchange,
to overcome the difficulties of barter, to bring about the
fluid market. And it does this not merely by acting as a
medium of exchange. The fact that goods can be <i>priced</i>
in terms of money, can have a common measure of value,
makes barter itself easier, as I have shown in my chapter on
"Barter" in Part II. There are many articles in trade at the
present time whose saleability is not much less than that of
money, in ordinary times. Wheat in the grain pit is surely
highly saleable. Stocks and bonds are. If it be objected
that in the wheat market there is always some difference
between buying price and selling price, if considerable
quantities are involved, it may be answered that the same
is true in the "money market" The man who has just
negotiated a three months' loan of five hundred thousand
dollars at 3&frac12;% may well have trouble in turning that
loan over to someone else immediately without shaving
&frac14;% from the money-rate! Besides, it is not true that
values remain unchanged when a big buyer shifts from
the bull to the bear side of the market. Buying price is
higher than selling price in that case partly because <i>his
economic power</i> has ceased to sustain the value of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
wheat, and the price would not correctly express the value
if it remained uninfluenced by that fact.</p>

<p>Further, as we shall see when we come to the analysis of
credit, one chief function of modern credit is to increase the
<i>saleability of goods</i>, and to enable men to use the value of
their goods in effecting exchanges without actually alienating
their property in the goods. It seems to me that the
drift of modern systems of exchange is toward closing up
the gap between money and goods, in respect of saleability,
rather than to widen it.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> But this is to anticipate later discussion.</p>

<p>It is not necessary, in answering our second question,
as to the reasons why gold and silver have become the standard
money of the world, to go far in the study of primitive
moneys. Wheat has almost never been money. The value
of wheat sinks rapidly with increase in supply, and is very
unstable. Wheat meets some other tests that fit it for
money, as easy divisibility, ease in standardization, and
even has some degree of durability, though subject to deterioration
and waste with keeping, and involving expense
in keeping. Carlile and Ridgeway think that wheat was
used to some extent among the Greeks in Southern Italy
as money, at one time.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> But this was possible because there
was a regular export trade in wheat&mdash;the same thing that
made tobacco available as money in Virginia. In general,
however, commodities which minister to easily satiable
wants are ill-adapted for money. And that is especially
true of current stocks of goods currently consumed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p>The accumulation of money, moreover, implies a stage of
human development where the accumulation of <i>capital</i> is possible.
It implies foresight, the suppression of present wants
in the interest of future wants, and almost always money has
been a commodity well suited to serve as provision against
future contingencies. Cattle, slaves, knives, fish-hooks,
cooking implements, and similar things have been money.
The "store of value" function manifests itself early.</p>

<p>But very early a different sort of commodity comes in.
Articles of <i>ornament</i> early begin to take the place of articles
that minister to more animal wants. It seems strange that
articles meeting wants which are commonly counted frivolous
and fanciful should distance those obviously necessary
in the race for a place as money. It seems strange that the
nations now at war should seem more concerned about their
gold supplies than about their wheat supplies.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> But it is
none the less a fact that men in all ages have been enormously
concerned about ornament. In warm regions, ornament
has commonly preceded clothing. Very early, necklaces,
bracelets, rings, earrings, nose-pendants, etc., became
objects of exceedingly great desire. And very early, gold
and silver were used for such purposes, and men made long
expeditions for them and fought wars for them in very
early times, before the money economy was developed far.
Other ornaments than those made of gold and silver have
also become money. Wampum, polished shells, iron ornaments,
etc., have all been money. The Karoks of California
were accustomed to use strings of shell ornaments as money.
When this was supplanted by American silver, they used
strings of silver coins as ornaments, dressing their women
lavishly with rows of silver dimes, quarters, and half-dollars!
Ornament and money are freely <i>inter</i>changeable
in primitive life. To-day, in the Western world, the thing is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
more specialized and differentiated, and the interchange of
money and ornament is largely confined to jewelers, bankers,
especially international bankers, gold brokers, and the
mints, <i>through</i> whom the rest of society make the interchange.
In India, however, the peasant's hoard takes the
form of bracelets, bangles, and earrings for his wife and
daughters, and the peasant himself seems to regard them in
the double light of provision for future needs, and as conferring
social distinction. They are both ornament and
savings bank, and are superior to a savings bank from the
standpoint of effective saving, since the natives would spend
what they put in the bank, but only famine can make them
dispose of the ornaments of their women.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Saving is a
practice not easily started. There are powerful motives in
human life making for prodigality. Social prestige comes to
the man whose hospitality is lavish. Social expectation,
which is the most powerful steady motive power in human
life, makes powerfully for prodigality. Thrift is a virtue
little esteemed among primitive men, and none too highly
esteemed among the masses in most countries. The grudging
person, the tightwad, the man who fails to do his share
of the treating, the woman who entertains her guests with
inadequate fare&mdash;none of these enjoy high social esteem.
To offset this, a motive equally powerful must manifest
itself. It would be considered mean and contemptible for
the Hindu to put money away instead of spending it on
feasts at marriages and funerals, and in hospitality on other
festive occasions. But he gains, instead of losing, in social
esteem and prestige, if he decorates his women with gold
and silver. Later, the advantage of such a practice as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
matter of provision against future wants would get into
men's minds, and would become an added incentive to
maintain and increase the practice. Thus the frivolous
and fanciful side of men's nature furnishes a powerful lever
for the development of both money and capital. In the
store of value function we find one of the earliest and most
significant functions of money. Carlile offers a wealth of
evidence to show this interchangeability of money and ornament
among many peoples, at different stages of culture.</p>

<p>Three powerful elements of human nature work together
in sustaining the value of the metals which become widely
used as ornament:</p>

<p>(1) love of approbation;</p>

<p>(2) the sex impulse;</p>

<p>(3) the spirit of rivalry, or competition.</p>

<p>In these three we have, perhaps, the firmest basis which it
is possible to construct for the value of anything! When
religion is added, as has often been the case with the precious
metals, the basis becomes solid indeed! Modern social
psychology has increasingly made clear the power of the
first. Social expectation can take the raw stuff of human
nature, and mold it into almost any form it pleases. Original,
hereditary differences remain. Some raw stuff is so
inferior that no high social organization can be built out
of it. Some stuff cannot respond very effectively to the
social stimuli. But <i>qualitatively</i>, the tendency is for men
to become what society expects. Individuals succeed
more or less in meeting social expectation. But the very
elements of individual aspiration and ambition, the very
self of the individual, are molded to the social pattern, and,
with the same racial stock, vary almost indefinitely from
time to time and from place to place, with the <i>mores</i>. If
ornament confers distinction,&mdash;and almost everywhere it
does&mdash;men will seek to possess ornaments.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span></p>

<p>Commonly it is for the sake of the other sex that men
seek ornaments. Ornaments are an aid in wooing! Men
gain wives by being able to give them ornaments.&mdash;Not
that this is the whole story!&mdash;And social expectation, almost
everywhere, requires that men decorate the wives that
they have won. Wives usually reinforce social expectation
in this matter.</p>

<p>Further, the desire for ornament is competitive. One's
women must be <i>better</i> ornamented than the women of one's
neighbors, if <i>distinction</i> is to be gained thereby. But this
sets a faster pace for the neighbors, and the standard of
social expectation is raised as to the necessary amount of
ornament. It is the same sort of competition that arises
among armed nations. A new battle-ship for one requires
that all increase their naval strength. New armies in
Germany call for new armies in France. A vicious circle
is created. The desire for ornament, unlike the desire for
food, becomes insatiable. And hence, the value-curve for
the metal used as ornament sinks very slowly, being reduced,
not by satiation of want, but by limitation of economic
resources. I need not elaborate these notions further.
They are of the same sort that Veblen has developed in his
<i>Theory of the Leisure Class</i>. They rest on fundamentals
in human nature, however much they differ from the psychology
of the "economic man." They give assurance, I
think, that, unless radical change in tastes and fashions
come in, which displace gold and silver from their position
as ornaments and as means of display, we may expect the
value of gold to maintain itself at a high level regardless
of great increase in quantity. I do not share the
view which Carlile himself seems, at times, to express<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
that gold does not sink in value with the increase in quantity.
It seems to me easily demonstrable that it has sunk,
and does sink. But I should expect the value of gold to
survive the shock that might come if gold were entirely
displaced from monetary use vastly better than any commodity
which serves wants of a different character could
stand a similar shock. The demonetization of silver has,
of course, not entirely displaced silver from the monetary
employment. It has, however, made it necessary for the
arts to absorb a greatly increased proportion of the new
silver,<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> and not a little of the old silver. The demonetization
of silver, moreover, was accompanied and followed by
a great increase in silver production. But silver has stood
the shock amazingly well.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a></span>It
is, of course, thinkable that the attitude of mankind,
under new social conditions, and with new tastes and
fashions, may change, with reference to gold and silver.
Love of approbation and distinction, the sex impulse, and
the spirit of rivalry, are eternal elements in human nature.
But their manifestations may change. There have been
times when love of distinction gratified itself in poverty
and filth and asceticism. Almost anything may be exalted
into a social ideal. Society may even reach ideals of such a
sort that a man may gain social approval and the love
of woman in high competition with his fellows in the service
of mankind! But even here gold and silver may have a
place. They are beautiful, as we now see beauty, and
beauty itself is good! The world is better if it has beauty
in it.</p>

<p>It is just as well to conclude at this point what I shall
have to say regarding the value of gold as a commodity.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a>
The same quantity of gold and silver may have widely
varying values, depending on the distribution of wealth
and power. It is not alone intensity of individual desire
that controls values, but also the social weight of those who
manifest the desire. And this depends on the legal and
other institutional values concerned with social organiza<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>tion.
The point is strikingly illustrated by Walker's<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
account&mdash;designed for another purpose&mdash;of the effect on
the values of gold and silver of the conquests of the great
Eastern empires by Alexander the Great and the Romans.
The production of gold and silver, for the great Eastern
empires, was like the rearing of the pyramids in Egypt.
All power was centered in the hands of a few despots.
Control of vast masses of laborers was in their hands.
The social values&mdash;it is difficult to classify them as legal,
economic and religious, since all three are blended&mdash;gave
little weight indeed to the desires of the masses, and tremendous
weight to the slightest whims of the despot.
Thus, since the love of gold and silver was intense in these
despots, and since religious considerations also called for the
accumulation of great treasuries of gold and silver, enormous
numbers of laborers, living miserably, toiled in the mines
to produce them, and amazing stores of gold and silver were
accumulated. The precious metals had, in these Eastern
empires, a high value per unit, since so large a portion of the
social energy of motivation attached itself to them. With
the conquests by Greeks and Romans, however, a great
change came. The old, gold-loving despots lost their
power. The conquerors had vastly less love for gold and
silver for their own sake. Moreover, the leaders among
the conquerors had very much less power in their own
social systems than had the oriental despots. Their soldiers
were in considerable degree free mercenaries, who had a
right to a share in the spoils, and who cared much less for
hoards of precious metals than for many other things. In
the new r&eacute;gime, the social centre of gravity was changed.
There remained few who loved great stores of precious
metals who had power enough to accumulate them. Mining
on the old basis was impossible. Though slavery per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>sisted,
more and more of the labor of slaves went into the
production of things that the masses of men could consume.
Gold and silver sank enormously in value.</p>

<p>Radical readjustments in the distribution of wealth in
our own day, might well make substantial changes in the
value of gold, without any change in its quantity. That
a more equal distribution of wealth and power, however,
would lower the value of gold now, as in the case just discussed,
is not so clear. The masses in the Western countries
are already fed and clothed, as a rule, even in times of
adversity, and usually increasing income for them means
increasing expenditure to satisfy less pressing wants, and
particularly to satisfy wants connected with social esteem.
The laborer's wife gets an expensive cab for her baby when
she can afford it. The negroes have gold fillings put in
their front teeth&mdash;sometimes when the teeth are sound!
The practice of giving wedding rings, and even engagement
rings, is spreading among the poor. Our American rural
poor, of pioneer stock, have had less concern for gold and
silver ornament than the masses of the Asiatics and recent
European immigrants. But among the rural poor in America,
as city standards spread, the tendency to use gold and
silver ornaments seems to be increasing, while we may with
considerable confidence expect, I think, that the rise of the
immigrant to better economic conditions will mean a larger
use of gold and silver on his part. Gold leaf on ceilings
and radiators would cease, doubtless, except for public
buildings, if great fortunes disappeared, and the use of
gold, at least, for plate, would be impossible in an economic
democracy.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> Silver might well gain in value at the expense
of gold if there were radical changes in the distribu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>tion
of wealth. It is notorious that prosperity among the
agricultural masses of India is promptly followed by absorption
of gold in that country. I venture no concrete
conclusions on this point, beyond the general conclusion
that a redistribution of wealth, with no change in the quantity
of gold, might well be expected to alter the value of
gold.</p>

<p>It may be added that the general impoverishment of
Europe, growing out of the present World War, will probably
lower the marginal value of gold in the arts (and hence
as money) in considerable degree. From this cause alone,
to say nothing of causes growing out of the money-employment
of gold, and growing out of the values of goods other
than gold, we might expect higher prices after the War than
before the War, for articles of consumption.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII</h3>

<h3>THE FUNCTIONS OF MONEY AND THE VALUE
OF MONEY</h3>


<p>In preceding chapters, I have spoken of the "money-service"
as a source of additional value of money, under
certain conditions. Before money can function as money
at all, it must have value from some non-monetary source.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a>
But, given this prior value, money performs valuable services.
These valuable services, in certain cases, add to the
value of money. Moreover, the fact that money, when
made of a metal used in the arts, lessens the amount available
for use in the arts, raises the marginal value of that
metal there, and consequently raises its value in monetary
form as well. It is now necessary to analyze the money-service,
and to see in precisely what ways it does affect the
value of money. And first, we must notice that the money-service
is not simple, but compound; that in fact there are
several services of money, in many ways distinct from one
another; that not all money can perform all of these services;
that most of them may be performed by things other than
money, that these services are not all equally important
as sources of the value of money, and that the same service
varies, from time to time and from place to place, in its
significance from this angle; and finally, that one of these
services which is of the greatest social importance, namely,
the "common measure of values" function, does not add to
the value of money at all.</p>

<p>I shall not now undertake a history of theories of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
functions of money. Many of the points which follow are
common property of many writers.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The nature of some
functions has been more clearly explained than that of
others. I have not found in the literature of the subject
any very clear statements, moreover, as to the relations
of different functions to the value of money. I shall try
in what follows, by a series of hypothetical cases, to isolate
each function of money, as far as may be, and shall try, by
varying my hypotheses, to indicate variations in the influence
of the different functions on the value of money.</p>

<p>The functions of money have been variously described
and named. The following list seems most satisfactory to
me:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
1. Common measure of values (standard of value).<br />
2. Medium of exchange.<br />
3. Legal tender for debts (<i>Zahlungs-</i> or <i>Solutions-mittel</i>).<br />
4. Standard of deferred payments.<br />
5. Reserve for credit instruments, including reserve for
government paper money.<br />
6. Store of value.<br />
7. Bearer of options.
</p></div>

<p>The common measure of value function rests in the intellectual
needs of man. It grows out of the necessity for
calculation, for bookkeeping, for understanding what is
going on. Any object of value may be used to measure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
the value of anything else, just as any object of weight&mdash;say
an irregular mass of iron&mdash;may be put in the balance
against some other object, and the relation between the
absolute weights of the two objects thus more or less
definitely ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> But it helps little, in getting at
the aggregate weight of a collection of objects, to know that
A among them is heavier than B, while D is lighter than F.
To get a knowledge of the situation adequate for quantitative
manipulation, it is best to compare all of the objects
with some <i>one</i> object, chosen as the standard of weight, or
common measure of weights. Thought is thus immensely
simplified. If we may imagine the calculations of a dealer
in a rural region, where no common measure of values is
used, it will help to make clear the nature of this function.
Let us suppose that he deals in nails, wire, cotton cloth,
eggs, butter, hams, sugar, and moonshine whiskey, and
that his customers also make and use most of these things,
using him as a central clearing house in their rude division
of labor. Without a common measure of values, it is
necessary for him to keep in mind the price of every commodity
in terms of every other commodity. If there are
twelve commodities, this means 66 ratios which he must
remember, according to the formula for permutations and
combinations. In general, in such a situation, there would
be the following ratios: (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + ...
(n - (n - 1)). Let him choose, however, one of his commodities,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
say eggs, as the common measure of values, and he
needs to bear in mind only eleven prices, namely, the prices
of each of the other eleven articles in eggs. Thinking is
immensely simplified. In general, with a common measure
of values, dealers need bear in mind only (n - 1) prices.
Suppose that at the end of the day, after considerable
trading, our dealer finds the following changes in his stock:</p>

<div class='center'>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="5" summary="">
<tr><th><i>He has gained</i></th><th><i>He has lost</i></th></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>8 doz. eggs</td><td align='left'>12 lbs. nails</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>3 gallons whiskey</td><td align='left'>8 lbs. wire</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>4 hams</td><td align='left'>13 lbs. butter</td></tr>
<tr><td align='left'>5 yards cloth</td><td align='left'>10 lbs. sugar</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Has his trading been profitable? How can he tell? Reduce
all the items in both columns to their equivalents in
eggs, however, and the answer is very easy. No complicated
business is possible without this common measure,
and common language, of values.</p>

<p>Be it noted that this common measure of values does not
necessarily involve the use of a medium of exchange. The
practice of <i>thinking</i> in a common measure is what is involved.
If the article chosen be eggs, which all are accustomed
to use, the service of a common measure might
easily be performed without the practice of indirect exchange,
assuming that other physical difficulties of barter
to which I shall shortly refer, were absent. Indeed, as I
have pointed out in the chapter on "Barter" in Part II,
a great deal of barter goes on in modern life, made very
much easier by the fact that we have a common language
of values, a common measure of values. For the easy
working of the system, it is important that the common
measure of value be an article with whose value the group
is well acquainted. The frequent testing of this value in
actual exchanges vastly facilitates this. But actual ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>change
is not necessary for the performance of the measure
of value function. We have cases where the measure of
values and the medium of exchange are different. Thus,
in the Homeric poems, we find indications that cattle
served as a measure of values, even though payments were
made in gold. The Virginians commonly <i>thought</i> in pounds,
shillings and pence, even when using tobacco as a medium
of exchange. The need for a common measure of values
would manifest itself in any complex socialistic society,
even though exchange were largely dispensed with. No
systematic plans for utilizing the resources of such a society
would be possible, no bookkeeping would be possible, without
some such device.</p>

<p>For this function, I prefer the term, "common measure
of values," to the term often used instead, "standard of
values." The latter term, as used in connection with the
expression "standard money," sometimes carries the connotation
of "money of ultimate redemption," and its main
function is thought of as serving in reserves. The reserve
function is a separate function, however. It is common
to have money made of the standard metal in reserves.
But this need not be the case. I would refer once more
to the hypothetical illustration developed in the chapter
on "Dodo-Bones": gold, not coined, as the "standard of
value"; paper as the medium of exchange; silver bullion,
at the market ratio with gold, as the reserve for redemption
of the paper. This may suggest that a distinction may
properly be drawn between measure of values, and ultimate
standard money. The paper money, in this case, would
be the thing of which the masses would ordinarily <i>think</i>, so
long as the system worked smoothly. And the paper
could serve as a measure of values. The case is not unlike
the case where a "standard yard," or "standard pound"
is kept for ultimate reference in a government bureau,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
while yardsticks or pound weights in the shops and warehouses
do the actual measuring. The cases do not, indeed,
run on all fours. The measurement of weights and lengths
involves physical manipulation; the measurement of values
is an intellectual operation, made by comparing two objects
of value. The comparison may be made in actual exchanges;
it may be made by an accountant's estimate; it
may be made by comparing the results of several exchanges,
in sorites form, only one of which involves the ultimate
standard measure. The yardsticks actually used may vary
more or less, by accident or design, by variations of temperature,
etc., from the standard yard. The paper dollars,
under a smooth working of the system described, would be
held closely to the ultimate standard, and would, in any
case, not vary as compared with one another at the same
time and place.</p>

<p>When the medium of exchange diverges in value from the
ultimate standard, as in the case of the American Greenbacks
during the period from 1862 to 1879, we have, sometimes,
shifting relations among the functions. The Greenbacks
were the measure of value most commonly in use.
They were legal tender for debts, except where gold was
specified in the contract. They were commonly the standard
of deferred payments. To a considerable extent, however,
gold was used in reserves, and even as a medium of
exchange. People <i>thought</i> in both standards. And finally,
gold remained an ultimate standard to which the Greenbacks
were referred, and by which variations in their value
were measured. The terms, "primary standard" (gold)
and "secondary standard" (Greenbacks), have been employed
to aid in straightening out this confusion.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> I think,
on the whole, that the term, "common measure of values"
describes the function which I wish to emphasize more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
clearly than the term, standard of values, and I shall, in
general, employ it for that purpose.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>The medium of exchange function grows out of the physical
difficulties of barter, rather than out of intellectual
needs. The discussion in the preceding chapter of the origin
of money has emphasized the nature of the difficulties which
a medium of exchange meets. A has an ox, which he wishes
to trade for shoes, sugar, and a coat. Neither shoe-maker,
tailor nor grocer cares to take the ox, however, and, besides,
no one of them could supply A with all three of the things
he wishes to get. Moreover, even if A should meet a man
who had all three things, he would not care to give up the
ox for them, since the ox is worth more than all three. If
there be a medium of exchange, however, A may sell his
ox to the butcher, and take his pay in that medium, which
will be something easily and minutely divisible, buy coat
and sugar and shoes, and take the surplus of his medium of
exchange home, waiting for another occasion. The medium
of exchange function overcomes the difficulties arising from
low saleability of many goods, due to limited number of
possible buyers, lack of divisibility, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The common measure of values aids greatly in determining
the prices, the terms, at which exchanges may be made;
the medium of exchange makes possible exchanges which
could not be made at all in its absence.</p>

<p>The measure of value function does not add to the value
of money. The medium of exchange function is commonly
a cause of additional value for money. The source of this
extra value is the gains that come from exchange.</p>

<p>Exchange is an essential part of the productive process,
where you have division of labor with private ownership<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
of the instruments of production, and private enterprise.
Values<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> may be created by changing the forms, the time,
the place, or the ownership of goods. All these operations
are necessary in an economic system like our own. Those
who possess money are in a position to take toll, in values,
from those who wish to get rid of the goods which they have
produced, and to get hold of the goods which they wish to
consume. The holders of money do this by means of the
money, and under the laws of economic imputation, these
gains are attributed to the money itself, first in the form of a
rental value, and sometimes, under conditions later to be
discussed, as increments to capital value.</p>

<p>Before giving full discussion to this topic, it will be well
to consider certain other functions, which are, or may be,
sources of value for money.</p>

<p>The reserve for credit instruments function cannot be
fully discussed till we take up credit. Provisionally, it may
be said that it is a source of absolute value for money, <i>per
se</i>, even though the effect on prices may be that, owing to a
rise in the values of goods, the prices rise. The fact of
credit may even tend to lessen the absolute value of money
itself, by lessening the value that comes to money from the
medium of exchange function. On the other hand, credit
increases exchanges, making possible a vast mass of
transactions which without it would not occur at all. Of
course, in our hypothetical case above, where the reserve
for credit instruments is silver bullion, the reserve for
credit instruments function does not add to the value of
money at all.</p>

<p>The "bearer of options" function of money is also a
source of value for money. It is a valuable service. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
man who holds money, waiting his chance in a fluctuating
market, anticipates a gain which justifies him in holding
his capital without return upon it. Money is not alone in
performing this service. High grade bonds also perform it.
They bear a lower yield per annum to compensate. The
service of bearing options is itself a part of the yield, and is
itself capitalized, in their case. Two 5% bonds, each equally
secure, but one of which has a wide market, while the other
has a restricted market, will have a very unequal value.</p>

<p>This "bearer of options" function is often identified
with the "store of value" function. The two are properly
distinguished. If a man has in mind a definite contingency,
at a definite future time, for which he wishes to hold a
store of value, he may well find that a high yield bond, or a
loan upon real estate, or many other productive investments,
will serve him better than money or bonds with wide
market. So far as money is concerned, the "bearer of
options" function is much more important than the "store
of value" function to-day. The reserve of value in liquid
form, for undated emergencies (like the War Chest at
Spandau, or the big reserve accumulated between 1900 and
1913 by the <i>Banque de France</i>), would, from the point of
view of this distinction, come under the "bearer of option"
function, rather than the "store of value" function. The
important thing about the distinction is that for one purpose
a high degree of saleability in the thing chosen is necessary,
while in the other, such is not the case. The most common
case of the "bearer of options" function arises when men
hold money, liquid securities of low yield and stable value,
short loans, call loans, or bank-deposits, waiting for special
opportunities in the market.</p>

<p>The medium of exchange function would exist in a society
where business goes always in accustomed grooves, where
uncertainty is banished, and where most of the assumptions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
of static economic theory are realized. If we push static
assumptions to the limit, and assume "friction" of all
sort gone, assume that all goods can flow without trouble
or expense to the places and persons where their values are
highest, etc., even the medium of exchange function would
disappear. But if we make our static assumptions a bit
more realistic, leaving the "friction" of barter, but banishing
the need for readjustment, and the uncertainties that grow
out of dynamic changes (whether caused by growth of population,
or changes in laws and morals, or in fashions and
tastes, or in technical methods, or by accidents of various
kinds), then the medium of exchange function will still remain.
Given dynamic changes, we have need for a vast deal
more of readjustment, and a vast deal more of speculation.
I have shown in the chapter on "The Volume of Money
and the Volume of Trade" that the great bulk of trading
in the United States to-day is speculation, which increases
or decreases with the amount of dynamic change, with
its accompanying uncertainty and need for readjustment.
The major part of the medium of exchange function arises
from this. The whole of it arises from factors which purest
static theory is accustomed to abstract from. The <i>whole</i>
of the "bearer of options" functions arises from dynamic
change. <i>This is the dynamic function</i> of money <i>par excellence</i>.
It is commonly treated by economists as an unusual
and unimportant function. Merged with the store of value
function, it is frequently treated as of historical, rather than
present, importance. In my own view, it is of high present
importance.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> I should count it as in considerable degree
a <i>function</i> (using function in the mathematician's sense) of
"business distrust"<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> waxing and waning in importance as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
business distrust increases and decreases. In past ages,
this function was primarily concerned with consumption,
money and other goods being held, at the loss of interest,
as a safeguard against personal danger and as a means of
subsistence in emergency. Increasingly to-day, it is concerned
with <i>acquisition</i> of wealth in <i>commercial</i> transactions.
When war and domestic violence were the main cause of
social disturbance, the consumption aspect was most prominent.
That aspect came strongly to the fore at the outbreak
of the present war. The heavy selling of securities, which
closed the bourses of the world, grew out of men's efforts
to get money and bank-credit as a "bearer of options" for
the old reasons. The old reasons explain in large measure
the accumulation of gold by the <i>Banque de France</i>, and by
the German Government, referred to above. But to-day, in
general, the main purpose of those who use money, or other
things, as a "bearer of options" is to make gains, or avoid
losses, in industry and trade. The man who, in a given
state of the market, is afraid to lend, or afraid to invest,
foregoes the income which lending and investing promise,
and holds his money. The man who sees uncertainty and
fluctuation in the market, and expects them to give him
bargains in time, foregoes income for a time, and holds his
money. The man who has investments of whose future he
is uncertain, and who fears to try any other investment
for a time, sells what he has, foregoes income, and holds his
money. It is not always possible, in discussing the money
functions, to preserve the distinctions between money and
credit, or money and "money" in the money-market sense.
How much difference is made by these distinctions will best
be discussed in our chapter on "Credit."</p>

<p>The significance of the "bearer of options" function is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>especially manifest, I think, in connection with call loans.
The "call rate" is commonly well below the regular "discount
rate," or rate for thirty-day, sixty-day, or ninety-day
paper. The explanation is to be found, I think, in the fact
that the lender of call money does not entirely dispense
with its service. He reserves a part of the "bearer of
options" function. To be sure, he will, in practice, have to
wait an hour or two, or even more for it,<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> and this may well
mean that he cannot take full advantage of an option.
But the right to demand money on even twenty-four hours'
notice is more available than a high-grade bond, as a means
of meeting rapidly changing situations. This principle will
explain, too, I think, why money-rates in general, including
even ninety-day paper, are usually lower than the long-time
interest rate on safe farm mortgages, or on real estate
mortgages in a city. The thirty-day rate will commonly
be lower than the sixty- or ninety-day rate&mdash;though exceptions
can easily be found, if the thirty-day period is to
cover a time of active business, which is expected to grow
less active during the second or third month. The influence
of the bearer of options functions is not the only influence
at work on the rates. If it be objected that the long-time
interest rate on high grade railroad bonds or government
securities is sometimes lower than current money-rates, or
just as low, the answer is that these bonds also share the
"bearer of options" function, and that the interest rate on
them is, like the money-rate, lower than the "pure rate"
of interest. Writers<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> have been accustomed to look for
the "pure rate" of interest, <i>i. e.</i>, an interest unmixed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
insurance for risk, in the highest grade of government securities.
I think that this is a mistake. I think that the
"pure rate" should be sought in long-time loans, of assured
safety, which lack a general market. Such loans, <i>at the
time they are made</i>, should represent the "pure rate" <i>for
that time</i>.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<p>I shall recur to the question of the money-rates, and the
question of the relation of the money-rates to the general
rate of interest, in the chapter on "Credit."</p>

<p>For the present I would call attention to the interesting
case of Austria, where the money-rates are normally very
low, because the volume of commerce and speculation is
small, and the volume of banking capital, politically fostered,
is large; and where, on the other hand, the general
rate of interest on long-time loans is high, owing to the
scarcity of capital in industry and agriculture, as distinguished
from commerce.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> This case may illustrate, incidentally,
that even as a "long run" or "normal" tendency,
an excess of currency in a country may lead, not, as the
quantity theorists contend, to high prices, but rather to
low money-rates. Austria presents simply a striking case
of what I should regard as the general tendency. The
money-rates and the interest-rates tend to approach one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
another to the extent that paper representatives of many
different industries get into the "money market"&mdash;to the
extent that industrial investments in general become saleable
enough for it to be safe to finance them by means of
short-time banking credit. When banks lend on collateral
security of corporation stocks to the buyers of those stocks,
they are, in effect, financing the corporation itself.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Industries
differ widely in the extent to which they depend
on the money market for their finances. The difference depends
often less on the nature of the industry than on the
type of the industrial organization. An individual farmer
cannot get the bulk of his credit that way! But there is
no reason why a well-organized corporation, assuming it successful
in agriculture, might not draw on the money market,
even if not so freely as a manufacturing corporation does.</p>

<p>For the contention that the money-rates for short periods
are lower on the average than the rates on longer loans, and
that the call rates are, on the average, well below all
time rates, there is abundant statistical evidence. From
1890 to 1899 in New York City, the average rate on 4- to 6-month
paper was 5.99%; the average rate on 60- to 90-day
paper was 4.58%; the average call rate was 3.29%. In the
same city, for the period from 1900 to 1909, the averages
were: 4- to 6-month paper, 5.61%; 60- to 90-day paper,
4.78%; call rate, 4.05%.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> This last figure for call loans
represents an average of quotations at the "Money Post"
at the Stock Exchange. While normally the call rates are
well below this, occasional high figures, like those in 1907,
pull this average up. The high rates at the "Money Post,"
however, are not always representative. Banks frequently
do not charge their regular customers as much as the quoted
rates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span></p>

<p>Even more detailed evidence for our thesis is to be found
in W. A. Scott's investigation of New York money-rates,
for the period, 1896-1906.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> He studies <i>two</i> sets of quotations
for call loans, those at the Stock Exchange "Money
Post" and those at the banks and trust companies; <i>seven</i>
sets of quotations (five of which appear regularly) under
the head of "time loans," namely, 30-, 60-, 90-day, and
4-, 5-, 6-, and 7-month; and <i>three</i> under the head of "commercial
paper," namely, double name choice 60- to 90-days,
and two varieties of single name paper.</p>

<p>He finds a clear tendency for the rate to vary with the
length of the loan, although noting many exceptions.
"The difference between these quotations rarely exceeds
one-half of one percent, and the general rule seems to be
that the influence of time in raising the rate grows less as
the length of the loan increases. For example, there is apt
to be a greater difference between the quotations of 60-
and 90-day paper than between 90-day and four months.
Likewise there is a greater difference between 90-day and
four months than between 4-months and 5-months paper."</p>

<p>The call rate, though much more variable than all time
rates, and sometimes high above them, is, on the average,
well below them. For the period, 1901-06, the averages
are: call loans, 3.3%; time loans, 4.5%.</p>

<p>The declining influence of differences in time as the
length of the loans increases, is what our theory would require.
If the "bearer of options" functions of short loans
is the explanation of the lower rate on them, it is a factor
which would count for less and less as the length of the
loan increases. A month's difference is all-important,
when the month involved is proximate, say the difference
between 10 and 40 days. But it is of virtually no importance,
from the standpoint of the man who wishes to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
meet sudden and indeterminate emergencies, whether the
note he holds matures in eleven months or twelve months.
The difference between a one-year loan and a five-year loan
might, on the other hand, still be important from the angle
of bearing options. The factor should cease to have any
meaning at all, or at least any appreciable meaning, when
the difference is between, say, twenty and twenty-five
years.</p>

<p>I have no statistical evidence that the one-year loan
can normally expect a lower rate than the five-year loan.
At times, short time financing may be even more expensive
than long time financing. But such study as I have given
to quotations of short-term notes of corporations, as compared
with the longer term bonds of the same corporations,
would leave the distinct impression that short-term notes
fare better in the security market, and yield less return.
A complication arises, here, of course, that the short-term
note may often lack the safety which a first mortgage bond
of the same corporation would have.</p>

<p>The legal tender for debts function calls for a brief discussion.
Whatever gives legal quittance from contract
obligation, or from legal obligation as for taxes, performs
this function. "Legal tender" money, in the strict sense,
is not alone in performing this function. Usually a government
will by law or administrative practice with the force
of law, bind itself to accept forms of money which it will
not compel other creditors to accept. Thus, silver certificates,
without being "legal tender," are a means of legal
quittance from obligations to the Federal Government.
Sometimes governments will receive only gold at the customs
house. This was true in the Greenback period, when
Greenbacks were "legal tender," but not good for payments
of customs duties. The reader who is interested in refinements
of the legal distinctions among different kinds of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
money will find the thing elaborately worked out by G. F.
Knapp, in his <i>Staatliche Theorie des Geldes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> But "legal
tender" money is not always an adequate means of quittance.
If the contract calls for corn, or wheat, or North<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>ern
Pacific stock, the best legal tender money is a poor
substitute! Witness the "Corner" in Northern Pacific
in 1901. It is doubtless true, as Davenport<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> points out,
that all contracts, whatever they call for, may be ultimately
met, under the common law, by money damages, but that
does not mean that a man can maintain his solvency or
position in business by offering money when Northern
Pacific is designated in his contract. Doubtless even there
money will free him, <i>at a price</i>, but Northern Pacific stock
is at least more convenient for the purpose! A man does
not need money to get free from debts, even when money is
required by the contract. He can turn in whatever he has
in an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, and get
free <i>via</i> the bankruptcy court. In other words, the legal
tender function of money, while it does distinguish money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
from other goods as a matter of <i>degree</i>, does not erect an
absolute difference of <i>kind</i>.</p>

<p>Under a smoothly working monetary system, where all
forms of money are kept at a parity by constant and ready
redemption, and where people have no doubt that this redemption
will occur, the legal tender quality which attaches
to part of the money is a matter of no consequence. It
adds nothing to the value of the money. In times of stress,
the legal tender quality may be a source of a considerable
temporary value. This is especially likely to be true of an
inconvertible money. The legal tender quality of the Greenbacks
led to a very considerable fall in the gold premium
in the Panic of 1873. I have mentioned this point in the
chapter on "Dodo-Bones," where part of this discussion
has been anticipated. In general, the legal tender quality
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>may be recognized as a factor in sustaining the value of
money, if as a consequence of this quality men take the
money when they would not otherwise take it, or take it on
terms which they would otherwise not agree to. Where,
however, the money is money which they are glad to get in
any case, the legal tender quality is a matter of supererogation.</p>

<p>The standard of deferred payments function, as distinguished
from the legal tender function and the medium of
exchange function, does not add to the value of money.
Of course, if the standard of deferred payments is actually
used in making the deferred payment, then it finally becomes
assimilated to the other two functions. But it is
quite possible to divorce them completely. Suppose, for
example, that the standard named in a contract in the
Greenback Period was gold, but that payment was made in
Greenbacks at the market ratio. Or, suppose that the
standard of deferred payments should be a composite of
commodities, the tabular standard, with the understanding
that the index number on the day of payment should determine
the amount of money to be paid. In neither of
these cases does the standard of deferred payments function
supply any reason for an increase in the value of the thing
which serves as the standard.</p>

<p>In general, the standard of deferred payments and the
measure of value functions do not, <i>per se</i>, add to the value
of money. The legal tender function may or may not do
so. The medium of exchange function, the store of value
function, the reserve for credit function, and the bearer of
options function, normally do occasion an added value
which is to be attributed to money, either as a capital increment,
or as a rental.</p>

<p>The question remains, however, as to the relation of the
rental value, and the capital value, of money. This ques<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>tion
is not easy to answer. As I have already shown, in
the chapter on "Capitalization" and elsewhere, various
complications present themselves in the case of money.
(1) In the case of money, the rental, and the prevailing
rate of interest at which rentals are discounted to make a
capital value, are not independent variables, but tend to
vary together. Thus, whereas increased rentals would in
the case of most income-bearers tend to give a higher capital
value, this is offset, in the case of money, by the fact that
rentals are subject to a higher discount. (2) In the case
of income-bearers generally, the magnitude of the income,
or rental, is causally prior to the capital value. The capital
value, in our illustration of the candle, the disk and the
shadow on the wall, is the shadow, while the rental is the
disk. This is the general relation insisted upon by the
B&ouml;hm-Bawerk-Fetter-Fisher line of capital and interest
theory. Productivity theories of capital have been criticised
on the ground that capital value is not productive, that
only concrete capital-instruments are productive, and that
they produce, not value, but goods, that these goods receive
value from the market, which is reflected back, but discounted,
to the capital instruments which produced them,
so that, in value-causation the line of causation is precisely
the reverse of the line of technological causation. Capital
instruments produce consumption goods, but the value of
the consumption goods is the cause of the value of the
capital instruments. In the case of money, however, this
is not true. It is the <i>value</i> of the money, the capital value,
which does the work that makes a rental value. The value
of the money is a precondition of the money-function. So
far as money is concerned, both "productivity theories"
and "use theories" seem vindicated. There is a "use,"
an "enduring use" in addition to the "uses."<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> (3) The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
capitalization theory, as hitherto formulated, assumes
money and a value of money. It is a part of the general
body of price theory for which this assumption has been
shown to be needed.</p>

<p>With reference to the second, at least of these points,
however, it has been shown that money is not unique.
Diamonds, and all other goods which have as part of their
function the conspicuous display of wealth, likewise perform
this function <i>because</i> they have value. This gives
them an additional value. Diamonds are bought for this
purpose, when they would not otherwise be bought, or when
they would not otherwise be bought in such quantity. This
additional value makes diamonds still more effective as a
means of displaying wealth, with a further increment in
their value, etc. We seem, here, to have an endless, and
vicious, circle in value causation, the value mounting indefinitely,
building upon itself, a sort of "pyramiding"
process. But the limitation comes from several angles.
In the first place, <i>as</i> diamonds rise in value, from whatever
cause, a smaller and smaller number of diamonds is required
to display a given amount of wealth! The increase in the
value makes each diamond so much more effective for the
purpose in hand that it tends to cut under the cause of the
increase. These two tendencies come into some sort of
equilibrium. I suppose that by making strict enough assumptions,
and limiting the problem rigidly, it would be possible
for the mathematician to work out a formula for this
equilibrium, letting the increment in value grow feebler with
each rebound, till at last it is dissipated in infinitesimals.
In the second place, diamonds are not alone in performing
this service. They must compete with other precious stones,
with the precious metals, with limousines and Turkish rugs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>with servants and livery, with houses and lots in restricted
neighborhoods, with opera boxes and memberships in clubs
which confer prestige, with a very wide range of goods, for
the detailed discussion of which I would refer again to Veblen's
<i>Theory of the Leisure Class</i>. The <i>differential</i> advantage
of diamonds, when it is borne in mind that the conspicuous
display of wealth is not the <i>only</i> purpose, as a rule, for which
any of these things are bought, that the concrete diamond,
or other good bought, is a <i>bundle</i> of valuable services,<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> of
which the displaying of wealth is only one, is not, necessarily
very great. For many people, other forms of wealth
do better. And, as a rule, diamonds would not perform that
service satisfactorily alone. A large number of diamonds,
without proper "setting," in clothing, servants, house,
opera box, etc., would excite ridicule, and fail<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> in their
purpose of gaining social prestige. They must be part of a
complex of goods of the same sort, to accomplish their
purpose.</p>

<p>Now it is the <i>differential</i> advantage of diamonds which
makes possible the extra value, in this use. If all wealth
were equally serviceable in conspicuous display, if cattle
and barns and shares in a coal mine or slaughter-house or
glue factory could display themselves as well as diamonds
can, and if possession of these things conferred prestige
as much as possession of diamonds does, this differential
advantage of diamonds would disappear, and with it all
extra value from that cause. Diamonds are members of a
<i>class</i> of goods, a restricted, but still large class, which possess
this advantage. We may apply the old Ricardian rent
analysis here, arranging goods in a series from the standpoint
of their capacity to perform this additional service.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
Bread would, for the purpose in hand, be a "no-rent"
good. Ford automobiles are probably nearly no-rent goods
now! That the differential factor is a <i>cause</i> of value in
land, as the Ricardian doctrine seems to hold, is not, I
think, true. If all land were of equal quality, and of equal
accessibility to the market, all land would still bear a rent,
if it produced goods which had value, and if the land were
sufficiently restricted in quantity.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> But here is a case where
the differential factor is an actual <i>cause</i> of value. If all
wealth were equally effective in displaying itself, no form
of wealth could gain in value as a means of display.</p>

<p>This proposition calls for one important qualification.
The fact that wealth, in general, confers prestige is, undoubtedly,
a source of stimulus in wealth creation and
acquisition, and a big source of the value<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> of total wealth.
It is probable, however, that it is so great a stimulus to
production that it defeats itself so far as the values of <i>units</i>
of goods are concerned. It stimulates production, which
reduces the marginal values that arise from other causes.
Thus, while a source of additional value to the <i>aggregate</i> of
wealth, it probably reduces the values of given items.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at length on the case of diamonds, because
principles applying there will give us important clues to
the case of the value of money.</p>

<p>Money, by being valuable, is so far equipped to perform
the money service. But its <i>differential</i> advantage over
other valuable things comes from its superior <i>saleability</i>.
Its original value comes from non-monetary causes, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
has been sufficiently explained in the chapter on "Dodo-Bones"
and in the chapter on the "Origin of Money."
The extra value which comes from the money functions
rests chiefly in its superior <i>saleability</i>. Saleability is itself
a cause of additional value. But here again we may arrange
goods in a series, starting with the least saleable, and
ending in money. Money has an advantage, but its advantage
is not absolute. Under a system of free coinage,
gold bullion is virtually on a par with coin, and even without
free coinage, bullion is for many purposes as good, and
for foreign exchange may be better. Modern credit, moreover,
as has been indicated before, tends to add to the
saleability of all goods, and so to lessen the differential advantage
of money.</p>

<p>Here, again we may see the principle that the extra
value that comes from the differential advantage tends to
limit itself. As the money-use adds to the value of money,
a smaller amount of money is required to do the money
work, and hence the source of the increment of value is
cut under. This principle will partly explain why the
rental of money cannot be capitalized in the same way that
the rental of land can be. Increasing the capital value of
land is not the same as increasing the productive power of
land. But increasing the capital value of money does
mean an addition to the power of a dollar to do money
work. It tends, moreover, to lessen the work that there
is for money to do, both by reducing the total amount of
trading, and by increasing the incentive to the use of substitutes
for money. Only a part of the value of the services
of money, thus, can be added to the capital value of money.
There is a further point which is important, as differentiating
money from diamonds: much more of the value of the
services resting on the value of diamonds can be added to
the capital value of the diamonds than is the case with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
money. The reason is that diamonds may give forth a
continuous flow, <i>in the same hands</i>, of the service of conspicuous
display of wealth. Money, however, can perform
most of its services for a given owner <i>only once</i>. For a
given owner, it can serve only once as a medium of exchange.
For one owner, it can serve only once as legal
tender for debts. It can serve indefinitely as a store of
value, or as "bearer of options." In these cases, however,
the relation between value of service and capital value does
work out in accordance with the capitalization theory.
The money thus held brings in no money income. It is
held thus only if the services which it performs are equivalent
to the income which would come if it were alienated,
and something which would bring in a money income were
purchased in its place. Money may have added to its
capital value the value that is created by <i>one</i> marginal exchange,
but the whole series of values which a dollar may
create in exchanges cannot be capitalized, if only because
the same owner cannot get them all. This holds strictly
true only so long as no credit arrangements exist. If
loans of money can be made, then the lender can take toll
on successive exchanges, and get an income which may be
capitalized in part, subject to the limitation already discussed,
that increasing capital value of money cuts into the
rental, and so, in large measure, destroys its own source.</p>

<p>Where money is not freely coined, there may be an increment,
growing out of the capitalization of the money-services,
in the value of the coin. The coin may be worth
more than the uncoined bullion. This need not be true.
If the amount of money work to be done is not increasing,
it will not be true, unless the value of the bullion declines,
and need not be true then. But an agio on coined over uncoined
metal is quite possible, and has frequently occurred.
Such an agio has limits, however. In the first place, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
bullion may be used as a substitute for coin, so lessening the
amount of work there is for coin to do, and lessening the
source of the agio. Bullion would tend to rise in value
from being thus employed, and coined money would lose
in value from a reduction in the services it performed.
Further, <i>anything</i> which has more than ordinary saleability
may be used as a substitute, in one or another capacity.
Again, the agio, if it appeared in a country where men are
accustomed to thinking about money, might well arouse
distrust, lessen the scope of the coin still further, and so cut
into its own source. But such agios have appeared, and
while a pure case, where the sole source of the agio is the
values created in the money-functioning, is hard to find, I
think it is not to be questioned that cases where this is part
of the explanation have arisen. I should be disposed to
find part of the explanation of the rise of the rupee in India
after the closing of the mints in 1893 in this factor. There
seems to be evidence, however, that Laughlin is right, in
part, in ascribing the rise to an expectation of the adoption
of the gold standard.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a></p>

<p>Modern money, in general, however, rests on a system of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
free, even where not strictly gratuitous, coinage. Coined
metal thus rarely gets, save to a limited extent or temporarily,
an agio over uncoined bullion. Uncoined bullion
is acceptable in a host of places where coin would otherwise
be used, particularly in reserves for credit instruments.
Bullion is even superior in international trade as a medium
of exchange. Credit paper (particularly bills of exchange),
is superior to both in international exchange, as a medium
of exchange, because of various reasons of economy. Such
paper is even used in reserves in many places, particularly
by the Austro-Hungarian Bank.</p>

<p>The fact of free coinage means, substantially, that the
state has made the money form a free good. How much
value is thereby destroyed we may best see if we ask precisely
how much the money form could mean <i>at the limit</i>.
Initially, the money form means simply the certification of
weight and fineness by a trusted authority. It saves,
therefore, the delay and expense of testing the weight and
fineness by assay, etc. It saves the trouble and delay of
subdivision of a formless metal. It averts many difficulties.
For small retail transactions, indeed for retail transactions
in general, the conveniences of coined over uncoined
metal are very great. Small transactions do not justify
the trouble and expense of assaying and weighing and subdividing
gold! In a country, therefore, where the bulk of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>the money work is in effecting small transactions, we might
expect a considerable agio for coined over uncoined metal.
This would be especially true if that country had few facilities
for credit substitutes for the coin, particularly for small
transactions. In a country like the United States, however,
where checks are often drawn for amounts less than a dollar,
and where the bulk of the gold, or standard money, is to be
found, not in circulation but in reserves, one need not anticipate
that the medium of exchange function would give a
big agio to gold coin, even if free coinage ceased. So long
as coinage means merely a certification of weight and fineness,
this conclusion will hold. For purposes of large
transactions, the item of weighing and assaying would not
be serious. Indeed, American banks are accustomed to
weigh even gold coin, in quantity. It goes by weight,
rather than by tale, and if light-weight, it counts for less
than its nominal value. The writer knows a bank which
has a considerable store of light-weight gold coin that has
been in its vaults for over twenty years. Such coin may
be counted at par in reports by the bank to the Government.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a>
It might be paid out through the window to customers,
who would not weigh it, in case of a "run" on the
bank. But it cannot be used in dealings with other banks
without loss.</p>

<p>Does the legal tender aspect of coin count for more?
Under a smoothly working system of free coinage, where
moreover, all forms of money are kept at a parity by ready
redemption, we have seen that the legal tender feature
makes no difference. Would it make a difference where
coinage is restricted? If we assume that the use of checks
for small payments, and the use of bullion in reserves, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
a given case, prevents the existence of an agio growing
out of the other functions of money, I think it clear that
the legal tender feature alone will not create one. But
suppose that there is an agio from other causes, will not
the legal tender aspect of money tend to increase it? Will
not men demand coin, which bears an agio, rather than
bullion, when they have the right to demand either? And
will not the agio then, in a way, grow out of itself, a bigger
agio appearing, because an agio has already appeared?
It does not seem to me that this need follow. If there be
an agio, then creditors will demand either coin, or bullion
<i>on a different basis from coin</i>. But so long as they get the
benefit of the agio, either in the form of coin, or of a larger
amount of bullion, particular circumstances, rather than a
general rule, will determine which they will demand. The
banker might well prefer bullion. The international
banker would prefer bullion. The man who wishes money
for retail transactions will take coin. Men will use the
legal tender quality of money as a means of getting the
benefit of what agio there is (though contract right, where
the contract calls for coin, would accomplish all that a
legal tender law would accomplish), but whether they take
23.22 grains of coined gold, or 25.5 grains of gold bullion,
will depend on which they prefer in the circumstances. I
do not see that the legal tender feature adds anything to the
case of restricted coinage that it does not add to the case of
free coinage.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> In either case, there will be temporary
emergencies, when panics arise, when legal tender money
gets an agio over any possible substitute. Solvency may
depend on it. This might arise under free coinage, if the
panic were acute, and if settlements had to be made imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>diately.
But as long as there is time for men to work
things out, I should not expect the legal tender feature,
<i>per se</i>, to add to the agio of coined metal even under restricted
coinage.</p>

<p>In general, the possibility of an agio for coined metal, under
restricted coinage, rests on the extent to which coin has a
unique function. In so far as substitution is possible, there is
no room for an agio. For many purposes, bullion may be
substituted. To the extent that credit is developed, and is
flexible, various other substitutes are possible. To the extent
that barter can be used, still other substitutes are possible.</p>

<p>Among an ignorant people, little accustomed to developing
new expedients, having an economic life that is not
flexible, having an economy based on petty economic units,
having little development of credit, accustomed to the use
of money in most transactions, money might well be, in
many connections, highly important if not indispensable.
In England, before the War, where no bank-notes under
five pounds were in circulation, and where small checks
were little used, an agio on coin might appear if coin got
so scarce as to be inadequate for retail trade, but for bank
reserves bullion would have served virtually as well as
coin, and with the stock of coin she had at the time England
could have gone on for a long time indeed with no more
agio than just enough to prevent the melting down of the
coin. In the United States, where checks can be used for
very small transactions, and where a high percentage (very
conservatively estimated by Kinley at from 50 to 60%)
of retail business is done with checks, the agio on coins of a
dollar or over growing out of retail trade might be expected
to be very slight. On the other hand, the legal requirements
for reserves in specified types<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> of money might, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
time, lead to some agio. I do not think that the reserve
function in England would ever do so. If we could combine
our use of checks in retail trade with England's absence of
legal reserve requirements, I should think that the agio
would have little chance indeed of growing great! If to
this could be added Canada's extensive use of small elastic
bank-notes, the chance would be still less. If bank-notes
of one dollar could be issued, the agio would be less still.</p>

<p>It is in the case of coins of very small denomination that
the agio might appear most readily. Such coins, if limited
in amount, and if given the usual restricted legal tender,<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a>
do not need redemption to circulate at face value, even
when made of baser metals. It is quite thinkable that
such coins should, even when redeemable, circulate at an
agio over the redemption money. In small retail transactions
the need for money to do business is most imperative.
Even here, however, there is large flexibility. The present
writer, during the period of money stringency in the Panic
of 1907, made much larger use of checks in very small payments
than was his usual practice, and the same was true
of various of his acquaintances.</p>

<p>I think that the quantity theorist, with his doctrine of
an unlimited agio through the restriction of coinage proportionate
to the restriction, is best understood if we say
that he has taken an exaggerated estimate of the imperativeness
of the need for formed money in the smallest retail<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
transactions as typical of the whole situation.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> I have elsewhere
shown, however, that, in so far as Kinley's figures
for 1909 give us a clue,<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> the total retail trade of the United
States is less than one-eleventh of the total of all transactions
calling for the use of money and checks. Of that total
retail trade, the part in which money is actually used is,
on Kinley's high estimate, between 40 and 50%,<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> and
the part in which money is imperative is much lower still.
Small retail transactions do not give the type for the pecuniary
transactions in the United States! They more
nearly do so in India, and the possibility of agio is, doubtless,
greater there. For our larger transactions, there is an
almost indefinite possibility of substitutes for coined money,
if profits can be made by making the substitutions. Beating
the agio would be a source of profits.</p>

<p>I repeat what was said in the chapter on "Dodo-Bones"
differentiating this doctrine of the agio from the quantity
theory doctrine: (1) This doctrine presupposes value for
the money article from some non-monetary source. It relates
only to a differential portion of the value of money.
(2) This doctrine denies the law of proportionality even for
this differential portion. (3) This doctrine is concerned,
not with the general level of prices, but with the absolute
value of money measured in the ratio of coin to bullion.</p>

<p>Under the system of free and gratuitous coinage, no agio<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span>
of coined over uncoined bullion is possible. Where small
brassage charges are made, as in France (or as in England,
where the interest lost during the period of coinage is
charged to the man who exchanges bullion for coin at the
Bank of England) there may be an agio of this amount,
though it often happens that this agio disappears, particularly
in England. So perfectly is bullion a substitute for
coin in England, that the Bank of England will often
forego its privilege of taking the slight toll in interest, and
will credit men depositing bullion with as much as if they
had deposited coin. From what has gone before, as to the
possibility of an agio, I conclude that the United States,
England, Canada, and possibly France, would be unable
to make large brassage charges. If the brassage charge
were much larger than the charges made by reputable and
well-known jewelers for assaying and weighing, etc., there
would be a large substitution of bars for coins, and the
mints would have little to do. However, it needs no arguing
that with free coinage, and either very low or no
brassage charges, the value of bullion and of coin will,
quality for quality and weight for weight, be virtually
identical, within a narrow range of variation.</p>

<p>What, then, shall we say of the way in which the forces
drawing gold from the arts into money manifest themselves?</p>

<p>How describe the equilibrium between the value of gold
as money and the value of gold in the arts? How construct
intersecting curves, presenting a marginal equilibrium?
The problem is baffling, and I frankly confess that what I
shall have to say does not satisfy me. I hope that some
critic may solve the problem better. I can point out the
difficulties of the situation, and can indicate reasons why
the sort of solution which the economist's training in marginal
analysis leads him to desire are not easily found. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
I fear that I shall fail to satisfy the demand for an application
of curves to the problem!</p>

<p>The first difficulty is that we are barred from the use
of our yardstick. Money is the measure of all things in
economic theory&mdash;except money and gold bullion! Of
course there are economic values other than those of gold
which do not actually come into the market, but even there
we can commonly, by the accountant's methods, make
use of the money measure. In very high degree, our conventional
curves of all sorts run in money terms, and assume
a fixed value of money. Clearly the money curve of
diminishing value for gold would tell us nothing. The
value of gold might sink as its quantity increased, but then
the value of the money-unit would sink <i>pari passu</i>, and so
the curve, with ordinates expressed in numbers of dollars
per ounce, would not sink. The value-curve of gold, expressed
in money, is a straight line, parallel to the X axis.
Possible substitutes in the form of abstract units of value,<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>
or of composite units of goods, of an assumed fixed value,
will have to be used if anything is used, but they are less
satisfactory in the application, and leave the analysis a good
deal less realistic.</p>

<p>If this were all, the problem would be easy! But there is
a second difficulty. We find the factors requiring gold as
money, if summed up in a curve, presenting themselves as
a call for the temporary rental of the gold. The money
functions are performed, in general, not by keeping gold,
and getting an endless series of uses from it, as in the arts,
but by passing it on, sooner or later. Even in the case of
the reserve function, the bearer of options function, and
the store of value functions, it is not expected to hold the
gold indefinitely&mdash;always there is the anticipation of some
time when it will be passed on again. A curve for gold in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
the monetary employments, therefore, would be a curve
showing the diminishing values of rents, or particular
services rather than a curve for capital values. The curve
for gold in the arts, however, would be a curve showing
the diminishing <i>capital values</i> of units of gold, as the supply
in the arts is increased. The two curves do not run in
common terms. But another and more fundamental
difficulty. In the case of wheat, we may construct our
curve free from complications, in idea, at least. On the
base line, we lay out quantities of wheat. For each quantity
of wheat, we erect an ordinate, a sum of money, or a
number of abstract units of value, as the case may be.
Connecting these ordinates, we have a curve, showing how
the value (or the money-price) of wheat descends as the
quantity of wheat increases. Given the shape of the curve,
and given the number of bushels of wheat, the marginal
value of the wheat is given. In idea, at least, it does not
matter, for the shape of the curve, whether the amount of
the wheat is great or small, whether the marginal value of
the wheat is low or high. If there are ten thousand bushels
only in the market, wheat will be worth $5 per bushel.
With 100,000 bushels, it is worth 40c. The fact that there
are 100,000 bushels does not lessen the magnitudes on the
higher portions of the curve. The nature of the services
which wheat performs is not affected by its value. This
is <i>not true of gold</i>, either in the arts or as money. In the
arts, I have already shown that one function of gold is as
a means of conspicuously displaying wealth. Gold is like
diamonds in this. <i>Because gold is a valuable</i>, it gets an
additional valuable service. This additional valuable
service enhances its value. The thing is checked, however,
before an endless circle is created, by the fact that as gold
rises in value a smaller amount of gold will display a given
amount of wealth. The value-curve for gold in the arts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
therefore, is not a simple thing like the curve for wheat.
It turns upon itself, in ways that I see no graphic device
for presenting. This is even truer for money. Men wish
to have, when they seek money, a quantum of <i>value</i> in
highly saleable form.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> The curve for the value of the
services of money presupposes a fixed capital value of
money. It is the capital value of money which does the
money work. Given a value of money, and given the
values of goods, we may see how much money is required
to effect a given exchange or perform some other money
service. Then, knowing how much value will be created by
each exchange, or other money service, we may arrange the
services in a series, a scale of descending importance, and
get a curve. This curve is, in fact, the curve which presents
itself in the money market. There we find a curve,
running in terms of money itself, so much money for the
use of money for such a length of time. But this is a curve
of demand for money funds, rather than for gold as such.
The "supply" that corresponds to this "demand" is, not
gold, but all manner of credit instruments, chiefly bank-deposits,
expressed in terms of gold. Such a curve is
clearly not to be put into equilibrium with the value-curve
for gold in the arts, (1) because it assumes a fixed value for
money (2) because it is concerned with temporary rentals,
and not capital values, and (3) because the demand it expresses
is not for the use of gold alone.</p>

<p>We may get some aid in reducing these complexities to
familiar terms if we employ the device of assuming an
equilibrium between gold in money and gold in the arts,
without trying to explain in quantitative terms how that
equilibrium is arrived at, and then see what causes will lead
that equilibrium to shift. In getting the laws of <i>change</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
we may get closer to the causes of the phenomenon itself.
The effort to reduce the thing to precise mathematical form
requires a degree of simplification which seems to me likely
to rob an answer of much significance.</p>

<p>Assuming that the equilibrium is reached, we may see
what factors would tend to cause gold to go into the money-use,
and what factors would tend to draw gold into the arts
use. We may also see how these changes from one side or
the other would modify the value of gold.</p>

<p>Assume that a manufacturing jeweler has extra demand
for his products. His products, of course, are composites
of gold, labor, and other raw materials, etc., but part of the
extra value that comes to his products attaches itself to the
gold that is in them. He now has an incentive, which was
lacking before, to melt down full weight gold coin in his
possession, or to buy gold bars which might otherwise have
been coined. To buy the gold bars, however, probably
means that he must have accommodation at the bank. He
borrows from the bank the amount he needs, giving a short-time
note, since he expects to make up his gold and market
it in a fairly short time. The paper of manufacturers of
gold will commonly stand well in the "money market,"
and this is especially true of those in whose hands the gold
is not worked up into such specialized forms that the value
of the bullion is a minor matter. (I find it necessary to
refer frequently to the money market, though a full analysis
of money-market phenomena cannot come till after
our discussion of credit.) If he must borrow to get the
gold, <i>then the money-rates will come into comparison with the
profits he expects to make from working up the gold</i>. This
will usually be true even if he melts down gold coin already
in his possession. He might deposit that gold, and so
reduce his expenses at the bank, either buying back his own
discounted paper, or getting interest on daily checking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
account. If he has to borrow to get the gold, he may get it
either by drawing gold from the bank directly, or by giving
a check on the bank to a bullion dealer, which may ultimately
lead to a diminution in the bank's supply of gold.
However he gets the gold, there is bound to be some reaction,
(1) on the bank's supply of gold, (2) on the supply of
loanable funds in the money market, and hence (3) on the
money-rates themselves. If he borrows from the money
market, he affects the money-rates directly (even though
probably, in a given case, not noticeably); if he melts down
coin, instead of depositing it (or paying it out to others who
may ultimately deposit it) there tends also to be less gold
in the bank's vaults; if he buys gold with his own funds in
the bullion market, the supply of current bullion for which
the banks also compete is reduced. In any of these cases,
the banks have less gold than would otherwise be the case.
The relation between gold reserves and the supply of money-funds
has been partly discussed already. We have seen
that there is no proportional relation, as Fisher, and other
quantity theorists contend. Loanable funds, on a given
gold reserve, are highly elastic. But the elasticity calls
for higher money-rates, and higher money-rates tend to reduce
the volume of trading, and check the demand. Borrowings
from the money market by workers in gold, therefore,
are much more significant than borrowings by other
manufacturers or merchants, because the latter are content
with credit devices, for the most part, while the workers in
gold withdraw gold itself from the money market. It is,
moreover, harder for the money market to resist extra
demand from the jewelers than from many other interests.
The assets of the jewelers, especially from those who do
not work the gold up in highly specialized forms, are exceedingly
liquid. Their paper, therefore, is exceptionally
good in the discount market. Usually, too, the larger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
jewelry houses have specially good general credit and high
reputation. There is, then, less disposition for the market
to look askance at an unusual supply of their paper than
would be the case with many other sorts of paper. They
tend to get about as low rates as anyone else in the market.
A money market under centralized control seeking to protect
its gold, might tend to raise discount rates on jewelers'
paper, but a competitive money market is very unlikely
to do so.</p>

<p>An increase in the value of gold in the arts would, thus,
reflect itself pretty quickly in the money market, first in
the form of added value for the services of money, and
then, secondly, in an increase in the capital value of money.
Indeed, an increase in the value of a single rental is an
increase in the capital value also, since the value of the
single rental is one portion of the capital value. Not only
does it mean a higher capital value for gold, but it consequently
tends to mean a higher "price." It does mean a
higher "price" for present money as compared with future
money. It tends, also, to mean a higher "price" of money
in terms of other goods. Meeting higher money-rates, all
borrowers tend to borrow less, and to buy less, to offer less
money for goods. It need not follow, however, that the
rising value of gold reduces prices. The rise in the value
of gold in the arts may well be a manifestation of a general
rise of values. General prosperity, rather than causes
affecting the value of gold in the arts alone, may have occasioned
the increasing demand for gold in the arts. This
would mean rising values for goods at large. It might
well be, therefore, that the rise in the values of goods
would offset the rise in the value of money, and that prices
of goods would rise at the same time that gold is being
withdrawn from the money market to the arts.</p>

<p>Business in general, as well as the jewelers, may be mak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>ing
increased demands on the money market. This would
tend still further to raise the money-rates. It would also,
however, tend to increase the supply of money-funds.
Commercial and industrial paper, in a time of buoyancy and
expansion, is particularly acceptable to the banks, and they
are likely to expand their loans despite the failure of gold
reserves to keep pace. They simply get along with smaller
reserves. Higher money-rates in such a case tend to reduce
the volume of business, but need not actually reduce
it, if there are bigger profits than before anticipated in
business transactions. Not absolute money-rates, but
money-rates in relation to anticipated profits from the use
of money, are significant. There is large room here for
flexibility, elasticity, etc. There is much slack to be taken
up by the money-rates, much slack in the fluid substitutes
for money in various functions, and much slack to be taken
up by the volume of trade. But all this will best appear
after our discussion of the money market.</p>

<p>I have said enough to indicate the character of the factors
immediately determining the equilibrium between gold in
the arts and gold in the money employments. In the preceding
discussion, also, I have discussed the more fundamental
factors governing the value of gold in both employments.
The problem of translating the fundamental theory
of value into money market terms, and of translating the
phenomena of the money market into terms of fundamental
values is not easy. Most of our value theory in the past
has been concerned with individual psychology, Crusoe
economics, trading in small markets with a few buyers,
barter transactions, etc. It has been abstract and unrealistic.
The practical students of the money market, who are
immersed in the facts of modern money, have got little
help from it, and have often been scornful of it. I hope to
be able to contribute something to bringing the two methods<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
of approach to common terms. They are correlative aspects
of the same problem. Each gives highly important clues to
the understanding of the other. Neither can be understood
without some understanding of the other. A theory of
value which cannot be applied in the money market, the
stock exchange, and the great field of modern business
generally, has small <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>.</p>

<p>In the next chapter I shall take up the problems of credit,
and the money market.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII</h3>

<h3>CREDIT</h3>


<p>Analysis and description are much more important than
definition. Definition at the beginning of a study is frequently
a fetter, rather than an aid to thought. This is especially
true in a field where phenomena overlap and interlace,
and where the "pure principle," "essence" or "<i>Wesen</i>"
of the thing defined never presents itself, but is only to be
reached by violent abstraction. To pick out one element&mdash;as
"futurity"<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>&mdash;as marking off credit from other things would
be an illustration of this. Or to take the notion of <i>promise</i>,
or contract obligation, in connection with futurity, is likewise
to limit the field unduly, on the one hand, and to include
things which do not belong there on the other. Thus,
a contract whereby A is to build a house for B by the end of
a year, receiving at that time, or in instalments as the work
proceeds, a sum of money, is not a credit transaction. We
have, however, promise, futurity, and a future payment of
money all called for in the contract. On the other hand,
if A sends B a telegraphic order for money, which B receives
three minutes after the money is entrusted by A to
the telegraph company, we have a credit transaction, with
no element of futurity in it. Certainly there is less of futurity
there than in the case where a laborer, working all
day, is paid only at night for work done in the morning.
Futurity enters into the values of all goods which are not
destined for immediate consumption&mdash;capital values of
long-time goods are discounted present worths of <i>future</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
values. Contracts, promises, and beliefs in promises run
through the whole range of economic life,&mdash;the domestic
servant, paid weekly, illustrates all three. Yet only a
special class of these economic activities are commonly
counted as credit transactions. Credit is really a part of
the system of economic value relations not easily marked off
in economic nature from the rest. Its clearest <i>differenti&aelig;</i>
are juridical rather than economic. It will be the purpose
of the present chapter, in part, to blur, rather than to make
precise, the line between credit and non-credit in economic
phenomena, and to assimilate the laws of credit to the general
laws of value.</p>

<p>This will involve, however, a careful analysis and precisioning
of certain phenomena commonly counted as
credit phenomena. Buying and selling on the one hand;
borrowing and lending on the other: the distinction seems
clear. It is in law. But what is it in economic nature?
When a merchant discounts his own note at the bank, it is
borrowing. When he discounts the note of another, his
debtor, it is selling. If he writes before his endorsement of
the note, "without recourse," (unusual at a bank, but common
enough with real estate mortgage-notes) he has made a
perfect sale, and is entirely out of the transaction. Is it,
however, in economic nature a different transaction from
the original one in which he got the note from a borrower?
Legally bonds are credit instruments, and stocks are not.
Stocks represent <i>ownership</i>. But practically, as an economic
matter, both represent the alienation of control, on
faith, to a small group of men, and practically, too, the
difference between preferred stocks and bonds is often very
slight. Whatever the legal rights of a bondholder, under
the terms of his contract, the legal fact itself often is, under
the growing practice of receiverships, that he cannot exercise
his right to foreclose without such difficulty that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
doesn't pay to do it. Very frequently indeed the junior
bondholder will come out of a reorganization as simply a
preferred stockholder&mdash;which is what he practically was
all the time. He couldn't vote as a bondholder, but his
voting rights as a stockholder commonly mean little! As
a bondholder, if he held enough bonds, he might even have
more influence on the affairs of the corporation than as a
stockholder. The market is moved by other forces than
the legal distinctions in corporate contracts! And market
facts are not necessarily correctly told by the accountant's
categories either. I shall trouble myself little, in what
follows, with the juridical and accountancy problems of
credit, save in so far as these bear directly on the more
pertinent economic aspects of the matter. I am interested
in the question of credit as a part of the problem of
value and prices&mdash;and particularly from the standpoint
of the problem of the value of money.</p>

<p>What difference is made in values and prices by lending
and borrowing? What kinds of lending and borrowing are
there? What shall we say of bank-notes, of bank-deposits,
of bills of exchange? What difference is made by the
money market? Behind the legal forms and the technical
methods, what are the psychological forces at work? How
are these psychological forces modified by the technical
forms and methods? What are the economic differences
between long and short time loans? How shall we draw
the distinction between the "money-rates" and the long
time interest rate on "capital?" Why can some things
serve as collateral in the money market when others cannot?
What sorts of credit are appropriate to commerce,
to manufacturing, to agriculture? Is credit capital? Is
an increase in credit an increase in values? The last two of
these questions imply that we have a definition of credit.
Perhaps the answers to some of the other questions may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
have given us such a definition. But analysis and description
will precede definition.</p>

<p>The etymology of "credit" has sometimes been taken as
the clue to the meaning of the word for economics, and the
idea of confidence, or belief, has been made the heart of
the matter. A man has good credit when others have confidence
in his integrity, etc. Men lend to others when they
can trust them to repay. Doubtless something of this
sort was responsible for the original choice of the word.
But when loans are made on good mortgage security, or on
collateral security, the personality of the borrower may
count for little or nothing. Confidence there is, but not
confidence in the intentions of the borrower. The confidence
is in the "goodness" (<i>i. e.</i>, the value and marketability)
of the collateral. The same questions are raised
by the lender here which he would raise if he were going to
buy the thing, instead of lending with it as security. None
the less, I think that in the etymology of the word we have
an important clue. We must generalize the notion, however,
beyond the limits of confidence in personal intentions.
It involves confidence in the general economic situation, in
the future of business, in the permanence of values, in the
certainty of future incomes, etc. Thus viewed, the element
of confidence, though important in highest degree, is not
peculiar to the phenomena which we call credit phenomena
in economics. It appears wherever there are values which
depend on future events. One does not need much confidence
in buying potatoes or apples or meat&mdash;though in
the case of meat quite a lot of confidence may be involved&mdash;and
misplaced! But whenever the future is involved,
whenever capital values of any kind are involved&mdash;lands,
stocks, bonds, houses, horses, manufacturing equipment,
etc.&mdash;the element of belief, confidence, hopeful attitude
toward the future, is quite as much present as in the case of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
a loan. Nor is the element of personal confidence less
present, often, in these things than in the case of a loan.
Very often the value of a horse may depend in considerable
degree on the integrity of the man who offers it for sale;
the value of a piece of land may be much enhanced if a
trustworthy owner makes certain statements as to the
yields he has got from it; the values of stocks (really credit
instruments, from the angle of economic analysis) may depend
very much on the personality of the organizers and
managers of a corporation. Personal prestiges may count
for much more in these cases than in the case of a collateral
loan.</p>

<p>Further, in connection with the element of belief, or
confidence. Borrowing is expensive, and men do not borrow
for amusement. That borrowing and lending may
increase, it is not enough that lenders have confidence in
the ability of borrowers to repay. Borrowers must also
have confidence in the future of their businesses, in their
ability to make enough out of the loan to pay the expense
involved, and have a surplus left over. I abstract here
from consumption loans. They play a very minor r&ocirc;le.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
The analysis in an earlier chapter, based on Kinley's
figures, showing that retail trade is less than one-eleventh
of the total pecuniary transactions in 1909, and that the
percentage of credit instruments used in retail trade is much
lower than in other transactions, will justify us, when quantitative
questions are involved, in abstracting from consumption
loans. Since such loans will be chiefly employed
in retail buying, and since we know that most retail buying
does not result from loans for consumption purposes, we
may conclude that modern credit is overwhelmingly of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
different sort. Most of it arises from business activities
of one kind or another, and rests on expectation of profit
and loss.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Such loans are not made when borrowers, as
well as lenders, have not confidence in the transactions they
mean to put through.</p>

<p>So far the thing has run in terms of individual calculation
of profit and loss. But even the most sagacious business
men do not play a lone hand. No one is uninfluenced
by the expectations and feelings of others. In general,
business confidence is in large degree a matter of social
psychology, resting on suggestion, contagion, etc., as well
as on cool calculation of profit and loss. Even where men
are able in considerable degree to free themselves from the
prevailing optimism or pessimism, they must take it into
account. The man who extends his business when nobody
is in the mood to buy, when no one will make contracts
with him, runs a very fair chance of bankruptcy, even
though there be, in the technical facts of industry, no reason
for the prevailing pessimism. A man with large resources,
which are not fully employed, seeing that the prevailing
"bad business" is "largely psychological" may,
indeed, take advantage of the fact, get his labor and raw
materials cheaply, and produce some staple in advance
of his market. If he can afford to hold his surplus, he may
make large profits by so doing. But usually business men
will not, in such a situation, have the surplus resources to
enable them to put through such an undertaking, and
hence, even though they may recognize that the rest of the
business world is irrational, they must, perforce, conform
to its irrationality, and their sober estimate of the prospects
of a given undertaking may be just as much adverse as if
they shared the feeling of gloom which all about them feel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
They meet it from the banker from whom they wish to
borrow. Even if able to borrow, they meet it from the
dealers to whom they are accustomed to sell their products.
The prevailing gloom is as much a fact with which they
must reckon as is the price of their raw materials, or the
technical qualities of those raw materials.</p>

<p>Further, business confidence is not a matter in which
each man counts one! There are centers of prestige, men
and institutions whose attitude toward the future counts
heavily indeed in determining the attitudes of others. These
prestiges may arise from various causes. Recognized
wisdom and probity may give a man great prestige in
economic matters. There are financial writers and students
of the market, not necessarily men of great wealth, whose
opinions are exceedingly influential in making business
confidence. The wisdom without the probity is not
enough. Some men, known to be sagacious students of
the market, have been known to succeed in their plans by
telling the truth, with the result that everybody else did
the wrong thing! They made business confidence, but not
the sort that was complimentary to them. Other men have
prestige, influence in making business confidence, by virtue
of possession of large wealth. They are, first, in position
to lend largely. Their decisions count directly for more
than the decisions of thousands of other men. The very
fact that they have confidence in the future, apart from
anything else, means a tremendous increase in <i>effective</i>
business confidence&mdash;which we are here concerned with.
The optimism of a man who can neither buy nor sell nor
borrow nor lend, because he himself has no economic resources,
and no prestige, is like the desire of a penniless
beggar for an economic good&mdash;its effect on the market is
not great! But further, the fact that a rich man is lending
makes possible activities which would not otherwise be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
possible, and so justifies confidence on the part of those
who wish to deal with those to whom he lends. Such a
man may, on the other hand, borrow. His borrowing, for
business activity, justifies confidence on the part of those
who would deal with him. Quite apart, therefore, from
any influence on the opinions of others growing out of
respect for his judgment, or less rational reaction to him,
he can do much to make or unmake business confidence.
But commonly, also, such a man is a center of prestige, as
well as a controller of economic power by virtue of his
wealth. Men look to him for their cue. If <i>he</i> has confidence
enough in the future to risk his great wealth, surely
smaller men with smaller interests need not be afraid. Vitally
important centres for the making and controlling of
business confidence are the banks. Having intimate knowledge
of the affairs of many business men, of business men in
many different lines, they are in a position to judge wisely
of business prospects. Having great power to make or
refuse loans, they can encourage or chill the enthusiasm
which business men may independently develop. The
whispered word of a banker may well count for more than
the half-page advertisement of a promoter. But the banker
is not all powerful. His influence is much greater, often,
in restraining than in evoking business confidence. Bankers
may during long periods be quite unable to increase their
loans, though they tempt borrowing by easy rates.</p>

<p>Business confidence is a fact of social psychology. It
is an organic phenomenon, with radiant points of control.
It is a matter of inter-mental activity, rather than a thing
in which each man makes an independent choice.</p>

<p>But this is to say nothing of credit phenomena that is
not true of all value phenomena. All economic values are
social values. The values of wheat or sugar or bicycles are
social values. There are centers of power and prestige,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
growing out of the distribution of wealth, or various other
social factors, which have a dominating influence on economic
values, as a rule. Credit phenomena are merely part
and parcel of the general system of economic motivation
and control.</p>

<p>In <i>Social Value</i> (pp. 102-103) I have denied the doctrine
of Meinong and Tarde that explicit belief, existential
judgments, are essential to the existence of values, taking
value in the generic sense, which includes &aelig;sthetic value,
religious and patriotic value, legal, moral, and other values.
I have pointed out that we do, at times, value ideal objects,
the creatures of our imaginations. The dead sweetheart,
or the Beatrice that never was (or that never was what she
was imagined to be) may have tremendous value. Not
merely things hoped for, but things hopelessly gone, as "The
Lost Cause" to the Southerner, may be objects of value so
high that other things, known to be real, may sink into
insignificance beside them. Even in these cases, however,
there must be a "reality-<i>feeling</i>" an unconscious presumption
or assumption that the object valued is real. Indeed,
belief, as distinguished from mere ideation, is an emotional
"tang," an essentially emotional, rather than intellectual,
fact. If it be present, the ideation and explicit judgment
may be dispensed with.</p>

<p>It is, however, characteristic of economic values, particularly
of the values of instrumental goods and of the
goods with which business men make profits, that the
tendency to raise the question of reality, to require explicit
judgment, is strong. The successful business man is
necessarily the man who does this, who does not too highly
value the creatures of his imagination, when he imagines
a vain thing. One need not, perhaps, seriously raise the
question as to the reality of the loaf of bread he buys. Explicit
judgment there would be superfluous. But very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
serious questionings come in whenever lands or houses or
securities or bills of exchange come in. One needs to know
what the facts are, and to make judgments based upon
them. Hence, for all values of capital goods and income-bearers,
for the values which pass in wholesale and speculative
trading in general, the matter of <i>belief</i> is vitally important.
Here, again, then, we have nothing in the psychological
principles underlying credit phenomena to mark
them off from the general field of value phenomena.</p>

<p>The general laws of value, then, apply in the case of
credit phenomena. We find nothing unique in essence in
them. The juridical relations, also, in so far as they have
economic significance, shade into one another. To buy
a bond from a bondholder is purchase and sale. To pay
a borrower money for his personal note is lending. But
from the standpoint of the theory of value and prices this
distinction may be ignored. We may extend the idea of
buying, selling, and price to cover all contracts where
values are balanced against values, and expressed in terms
of each other. Future money has its price in present
money, just as much as present wheat has its price in
present money. Really it is not future money against
present money. It is a case of <i>rights</i>, which involve the
payment of money in the future, sold for money, and priced
in money. In general, it is <i>rights</i>, rather than <i>things</i>,
which pass in economic exchange. Physical delivery does
not constitute selling. Delivering a load of wheat to a
railroad does not constitute sale of the wheat to the railroad;
selling a farm does not involve any physical moving
of the farm. Rights, <i>in personam</i> or <i>in rem</i>, are objects
of economic value, and the exchange of these rights makes
up the bulk, if not the whole, of economic exchange. (Exchange
may be limited to the transfers of juristic rights,
without value being so limited. I have discussed the rela<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>tions
of value and exchange in the chapter on "Value,"
above.) Property rights are commonly conceived of as the
proper objects of buying and sale. Contracts involving
the future services of free men stand legally on a different
footing from contracts regarding physical goods. But
economic analysis is not greatly concerned with these distinctions,
except in so far as they affect the values of the
things exchanged, and so the terms of the exchanges. I
do not believe that the legal distinctions can be made to
run on all fours with any significant economic distinctions,
and shall not undertake to make them do so. In the
phenomena we have simply cases of buying and selling (in
a generalized sense of those terms) of <i>rights</i>, at <i>prices</i> (by a
very slight extension of the term, price, to which the market
is well accustomed). The terms of these exchanges, the
prices, are governed by values, social economic values, in
no wise different from the values which govern the prices
in exchanges which we do not class as credit transactions.
I say that credit phenomena are exchanges of rights. This
is true of all exchanges. We do not exchange rights for
money. We exchange rights to other things for rights to
money. The mere physical transfer, even of money, does
not give rights to the money. I may merely be giving you
the money for safe keeping, or for use for my purposes.
While the law makes the rights to money that has left the
hands of its owner less lasting, as against innocent third
parties, than in the case of other objects, and while the
right to money is always, or almost always, met by returning
other money of equal amount, even in the case of money
it is a right, and not a mere physical transfer, that is significant.</p>

<p>Our problem regarding credit is, then, much simplified.
We have simply to pick out certain economic exchanges to
which the name of credit transactions has been applied,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>&mdash;a
various and heterogeneous set of exchanges, in many
ways&mdash;and study them, to find their peculiarities. These
peculiarities will not make them exceptions to the general
laws of value. They will make them merely special cases.
To find essential principles marking off credit transactions,
at large, from non-credit transactions is an exceedingly
difficult thing. There are more differences among credit
transactions themselves, than there are between the genus,
credit transactions, and the class of things not called by
that name.</p>

<p>Thus, monthly payments of rent, of wages, of college
professors' salaries, are not commonly called credit transactions.
The monthly payment of grocery bills, or of telephone
bills, involves credit. Where is a real difference to
be found? On the other hand, between book credit between
grocer and patron on the one hand, and a bank-note
or deposit credit on the other, the difference is large, in
many practically important ways. Between a call loan
and a ten year agricultural mortgage-note, the differences
are even greater.</p>

<p>One may be disposed to find the differences between
credit transactions and non-credit transactions in the fact
that the former stipulate a definite sum of money, due at
definite times. This would partly differentiate a bond,
say, from a stock. The bond not merely calls for stipulated
yearly payments, but also calls for a definite payment at
the end. This would, however, exclude British Consols
from the list of credit instruments! British Consols differ
from safe preferred stocks in legal, rather than in economic,
ways. Legally they are alike in that no terminal payment
is called for. Practically they are alike in that annual
regular sums may be expected. It may at least be said of
credit transactions that stipulated money payments, either
at a different time or a different <i>place</i>, are called for. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
would include the telegraphic transfers of funds, and would
exclude the case where A, a farmer, does a day's work for
B, a neighbor, for the promise of a day's work in return at
a later season. The latter transaction involves many of
the elements that definitions of credit have included, but I
think that we may at least limit our conception of credit
transactions to transactions within a money economy,
where money, as a measure of values, functions in the
calculations. Shall we, however, limit credit transactions
to cases where a stipulated <i>amount</i> of money is named in
the contract, for a stipulated time?</p>

<p>Shall we exclude contracts where the payment of money
is made contingent on anything? By contingency here I
mean legal contingency. This test would exclude the
highest grade preferred stock. It would include the
shakiest bonds that contained, in the terms of the contract,
no contingency. But where, then, would one place
such an instrument as the Seaboard Airline Adjustment
5% Bonds, which may default in a given year half of the
interest, if it is not earned,<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a> and which yet call for the payment
of the principal at a stipulated time?</p>

<p>What shall we say of "borrowing and carrying" transactions
on the stock exchange? Is not the loan of stocks a
real credit transaction? Ordinarily, when stocks are put
up as collateral, one thinks of the money as being lent, and
the stock merely as a pledge. But in the case of borrowing
stocks by a bear to deliver next day, the transaction is
definitely thought of as a loan of stock. It is sometimes
paid for, the bear paying the bull a premium, instead of
receiving interest on the money he has turned over to the
bull as a "pledge." The more usual thing, is, of course,
for the bull to pay the bear interest. But in a contract<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
like this, there are many contingencies. As the stock rises
in value, the bear must lend more money to the bull; if
the stock falls, the bull must return part of the money to
the bear. Both times and amounts are here contingent,
even though in the end the amounts lent and repaid balance.
Call loans, of course, do not call for payment at a stipulated
time, and the same is true of bank-deposits and bank-notes,
and of many other forms of credit. Interest on deposits
in mutual savings banks is contingent, legally, as to amount.
Are insurance policies credit instruments? What of endowment
policies?</p>

<p>It is easy to draw legal distinctions in all these cases,
but to show that definite and uniform economic consequences
flow from these legal distinctions is quite impossible.
Rather, it is easily possible to show that uniform or
certain economic consequences do not, in general, flow
from them.</p>

<p>I shall refrain from the effort to give a general, fundamental
definition of credit. I shall rather discuss certain
of the more important types of what have been called credit,
with a view to seeing what bearing they have on the problems
with which this book is concerned; the value of money,
and prices. The general class of transactions to which the
name, credit transactions, has been applied may be roughly
designated as transactions in which the consideration on
one side, at least, is the assumption of a debt, running in
terms of money (though not necessarily to be paid in actual
money), payable either at a future time or at another place.
Objections can be found to this definition. It does not
meet the fundamental test of a definition that, for the purpose
in hand, it should seize upon the essential and unique
characteristic of the things marked off. I am not sure that
it meets the tests of inclusiveness and exclusiveness even
for those transactions which we call credit transactions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
Thus, if A and B go to the bank together, and A there buys
B's horse, standing in front of the bank, giving B in return
a check, which B immediately cashes in the same room
where the check is drawn, the idea of different time or
different place is not realized in any but a technical sense.
A, in drawing the check is, of course, assuming a debt. The
check, if repudiated by the bank, becomes a note, which A
must pay. A, moreover, is paying B, not with money, but
with the transfer of a claim on the bank, and the fact that
his check, if unpaid, becomes a note is not the main fact
about the check. Understanding our definition of credit
to cover this case also, however, and attaching no fundamental
importance to the definition save as a means of
marking off a class of more or less related phenomena
which we mean to discuss, the definition will serve.</p>

<p>Thus defined, we have in credit a concept susceptible to
quantitative treatment. Debts, in terms of money, can be
summed up, and we may have the concept of the "volume
of credit" as the sum of such debts at a given time, or
through a given period of time, or as an average through a
period of time. We may distinguish credit transactions
from credit, defining credit as the volume of debts, and
credit transactions as transactions in which the debts are
passed in exchange. This would be to broaden the notion
of credit transactions beyond the usual conception, since
it would include transactions in which A sells ("without
recourse") B's note to C. It would also include cases
where bonds are sold. It would exclude cases where stocks
are sold, since they are not legally debts. Some would
prefer to limit the notion of credit transaction to transactions
in which there remains some contingent responsibility
on the part of the one who uses the credit instrument, but
this would be to deny the name, credit transaction, to cases
where bank-notes or government paper are used in pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>ments,
as well as to deny it to the case where bonds are
sold. It is not important, for my purposes, to draw a sharp
line about the concept, credit transaction, however. And
about the concept credit itself I have drawn a line resting
on a legal, rather than an economic, distinction.</p>

<p>Within the field of credit, thus defined, we may single
out for especial consideration certain forms of demand or
short time credit, particularly bills of exchange, bank-notes
and bank-deposits, and merchants' book-credit. We shall
also have something to say regarding long-time credit, including
bonds, and mortgage-notes that have no general
market.</p>

<p>All these debts in terms of money, to which, in the aggregate,
we have given the name, volume of credit, have grown
out of <i>exchanges</i>. Exchange is here used in a wide sense,
and is not confined to the case where goods or services are
bought and sold. It is an exchange, if a man gives his
note to a banker in return for a deposit credit. But, on
the assumption that exchanges are made only when gains
are to be realized, it follows that all debts, and so all credit,
have been created in view of anticipated gains (or to avert
anticipated losses). In a society where everything is in
equilibrium, a "static state," where there are no "transitions"
to be effected, where there is no occasion for speculation,
and where exchanges of lands, etc., are negligible, the
volume of all exchanges, including those where debts are
passed in exchange, would be small. The occasion for the
creation of the debts which make up the volume of credit
would not be nearly so numerous as under dynamic conditions.
The <i>volume</i> of credit, in other words, is largely a
function of dynamic conditions, even though credit would
exist in a static condition of economic life. The bulk of
credit, as the bulk of exchanging, grows out of dynamic
conditions, transitional changes, and the like.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span></p>

<p>This will be clearer when we raise the question as to <i>why</i>
debts are created, as to what function debts perform in
economic life. Why should a man borrow? Let us suppose
that a farmer has 600 acres of land. He wishes to sell
100 acres, and use the proceeds in buying equipment for
his farm. But he finds it difficult to sell the 100 acres.
There is no ready market. He can sell it immediately
only at a great sacrifice. By waiting, and looking industriously
for a customer, or by engaging a real estate dealer
to do so, he could finally find a buyer, but the thing is slow
and uncertain, and he wishes to get the equipment at once.
He borrows, therefore, giving his farm as security, or a part
of the farm as security. He exchanges a claim on the future
income of the farm for present money, and with this he can
buy the equipment he needs. The net result has been that
the credit transaction has transformed his unmarketable
quantum of value into a marketable form of value. He
has been able, by an indirect step, to do what he could not
do directly&mdash;to trade a part of the farm (which in its economic
essence is a prospect of future income) for the equipment.
In this illustration, <i>credit has functioned as a means
of increasing the marketability or saleability of non-pecuniary
forms of wealth</i>. Credit is primarily a device for effecting
exchanges that could not otherwise be effected, or for effecting
exchanges more easily than they could otherwise be
effected. This means that credit transactions are a part
of the productive process, and that they increase values.
It is the function of credit to universalize the characteristic
of money, high saleability. It is the function of credit to
"coin," so to speak, rights to goods on shelves, lands, etc.,
etc., into liquid rights, bearing the dollar mark, which are
much more highly saleable than the rights in their original
form were, and which often become as saleable as money
itself, functioning perfectly as money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span></p>

<p>Credit thus tends to universalize that characteristic
which Menger<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> considers the unique characteristic of
money. By means of credit transactions, a man borrows
up to 50% of the value of the farm, makes his farm in effect,
50% saleable or fluid. The man who owns livestock may
not be able, on a given day, to market them without loss,
but he can use their value in the market, up, say, to 75%,
by a loan. The man who owns a hundred shares of United
States Steel may not be able, at a given time, to market
them to his satisfaction&mdash;though in the case of articles and
stocks dealt in the speculative markets saleability is very
high indeed, and in the case of United States Steel, in particular,
the "spread" between "buying price" and "selling
price" is very narrow&mdash;but he can borrow, with the stock
as security, up to 80% of its value. On a bond of the
United States government, he may borrow up to 100%.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a>
The process of creating credit is a process of transforming
rights from unsaleable to saleable form. Often this means
the subdivision of rights, preferential rights to a <i>portion</i> of
the value of a piece of wealth being more saleable, because
of greater certainty, than the total right to the whole.
Another reason why partial rights may be more saleable is
that the value represented by each partial right is smaller.
It is easier to market things worth a thousand dollars than
things worth fifty thousand, as a rule. In any case, a
chief economic function of credit is,&mdash;<i>the</i> chief function for
our purposes&mdash;to make fluid and saleable articles of wealth
other than money; to universalize the quality of saleability.</p>

<p>This justifies us in our contention made before that <i>all</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
corporate securities, whether stocks or bonds,<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> are, in
economic nature, alike. Driven to a legal concept for a
definition of credit, we were obliged to exclude stocks from
our rough definition. But corporate organization does
precisely what the various other transactions that we have
called credit transactions do. Lands and buildings and
machinery, or the roadbed and rolling stock of a railroad,
are highly specialized, often unfit for use in any form other
than that in which they now appear. As concrete instruments
of production, they would be highly unsaleable.
In their totality, as a going concern, they are highly unsaleable,
because in the aggregate so very valuable. Grouped
together, however, but still subdivided, the objects of many
thousands of partial rights, represented by stocks and
bonds, they become saleable in high degree.</p>

<p>As objects other than money gain in saleability, they
tend to gain in value, also. This is not necessarily true,
always. If wealth is already in the best place, at the
proper time, and in the proper hands, no point is involved
in further exchanges. Additional saleability&mdash;or an increase
in the qualities that make for saleability&mdash;could
make no difference. But when objects could be employed
to greater advantage if in different hands, if, in other words,
there is occasion for exchange, then whatever adds to the
saleability of a good adds to its value. What would otherwise
have gone into the trouble and expense of marketing
now is saved. In general, items of wealth tend to gain in
value as they gain in saleability&mdash;though not in any definite
proportion.</p>

<p>Further, as objects of value other than money gain in
saleability, money tends to lose its <i>differential advantage</i> in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
this respect, and so tends to lose that part of its value which
comes from the money-uses. If all things, including gold,
were equally saleable, there would be no <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> for
money, and gold would have only the value that comes
from its commodity functions. In so far as credit-arrangements
give to partial rights to wealth the capacity to serve
as a medium of exchange or for other money purposes&mdash;and
this is true to a high degree of bank-credit&mdash;this tends
to cut under the sources of value of money. Credit thus,
from two angles, tends to raise prices; it raises the values of
goods; and it tends to lower the value of money. The
limits on this, however, are reached when gold ceases entirely
to function as money, and when all items of value
are perfectly saleable. Then credit has done its perfect
work for prices, and can do no more. No incentive remains
for further borrowing, if all items of value that need
to be exchanged are perfectly saleable.</p>

<p>These theses will meet objection, particularly from those
who are accustomed to quantity theory reasoning, and
who look upon the volume of credit as something independent
of the volume of trade. On the logic of the quantity
theory there is no reason why prices might not mount indefinitely,
if only credit could increase indefinitely. The
causes controlling the volume of credit are, on this view,
quite independent of the volume of trade. I have given
this line of thought sufficient criticism, perhaps, in Part II,
but shall find occasion to recur to it at a later point in this
chapter. However, writers not bound by quantity theory
ideas, may still find reason to question these theses, and it is
necessary that I should take account of various complications,
and make what may well be called substantial qualifications
and modifications, before the theses are acceptable.</p>

<p>First, objection will be offered to the doctrine that all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
credit is merely rights to wealth, that credit rests on wealth.
It will be urged that many loans are made without collateral,
or mortgage security, that the "personal credit"
of the borrower is the only security, and the only basis of
the loan. This objection is not serious. There are, doubtless,
loans which are disguised benevolences, where the
lender gets nothing good in return for his loan. I abstract
from such cases. Quantitatively they are not important,
and qualitatively they are not really commercial transactions.
In general, when a good merchant borrows at the
bank on his personal note, the bank knows very well what
goods he has in stock, what prospects he has for marketing
them, what other debts he has, what his "net worth" is.
And the bank knows that it has legal claims, even though
not preferred claims, on his wealth. When a young business
man borrows capital from a neighbor, giving no security
because he has no marketable wealth which would serve as
security, he is, none the less, exchanging a valuable right
for the loan. He is giving the lender a right to a preferential
share in his future income. The lender has considered
the young man's abilities as sources of income, in
conjunction with the capital lent. Incidentally, the lender
retains rights, preferential rights as against the young man
himself, in the quantum of value he has turned over to him.
If a young man borrows the resources with which he buys
a farm, the lender takes a mortgage on the farm itself.
Transactions of this sort frequently have in them the element
of benevolence, and the considerations are not always
strictly commercial. In the case of a young man of unusual
ability, however, who insures his life for the benefit
of the lender, such transactions may be perfectly good
commercial transactions, value balancing value in the exchange.
The thing traded is commonly present money (or
its equivalent) for rights to future money income.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span></p>

<p>Public loans present no exception to our rule. They
represent the transfer of present wealth for the future income
which the government, by virtue of its public domain,
or, more commonly, its taxing power, may expect to receive.
With a strong government, this future income may
be a very substantial part of the total income of the people.
Public loans may often be for commercial purposes, as
when municipalities borrow to build or extend municipal
enterprises. In cases of this sort, the market frequently
will consider the prospects of commercial success of the
enterprises in fixing the value of the municipal bonds.
Where the proceeds of the loan are for non-commercial
purposes, as war, the question of the future income of the
government will still, ordinarily, be a dominant factor in
determining the value of the securities. Often, however,
there is the direct action of patriotic fervor, etc., enhancing
the values of government securities. We have seen this in
the case of government money. It is no part of our theory
to maintain that men's calculations are always rational, or
that the whole of the value of a long-time income-bearer
rests on the anticipated income. But this is no peculiarity
of credit phenomena. The same thing is true of lands, for
example. Capital values often get independent in part
of their "presuppositions," as we have seen in the chapter,
<i>supra</i>, on "Economic Value." War security issues often
represent the effort of the government&mdash;as at the present
time&mdash;to bring into the present every possible bit of future
values, as a means of increasing their power in a desperate
struggle. The high prices of goods in such a situation
represent the concentration of future values into the present,
an increase in the motivating power which stimulates
the people to unwonted exertions. In war time, moreover,
many <i>ideal</i> values,&mdash;those whose fate is dependent
on the outcome of the war&mdash;enter into and increase the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
values of those goods which are needed for carrying
on the war. This leads to larger sacrifices of future income
than would ordinarily be tolerated. It is not so
much a case of present goods rising because of extra
credit, as of extra credit because present goods are more
valuable.</p>

<p>A second objection would be raised that in many cases,
the values pledged by the borrower could not exist if the
lender did not make the loan. This would be particularly
the case with credit granted for the starting of a new or
novel enterprise, which as yet exists only in idea. The
established merchant, with goods on his shelves, or with a
bill of lading for goods which he has sold, has a very tangible,
concrete basis for a loan, whose value is independent
of the decision of any given banker. If my doctrine is to
be taken as holding that all credit rests on concrete physical
goods, very many exceptions indeed could be found. But
this is not my doctrine. It is that credit rests on valuable
<i>rights</i>. These rights may be rights to existing concrete
goods; they may be rights to future incomes. In any case,
it is the values, rather than the physical quantities, that
are significant. Witness cotton before and after the outbreak
of the World War. Ultimately, in general,<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> economic
values come from the "primary values" or "first
order" values of consumption goods and services. These
values are reflected back, by the imputation processes, to
the various "factors of production" which have made
the existence of the goods and services possible, in accordance
with well-known laws which need not be here elaborated.
But the category of "factors of production" is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
far from exhausted when we have named land, labor, and
produced instruments of production! Some writers have
rejected the notion of "factors of production" largely or
altogether, and prefer such a term as "agents of acquisition."<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
I certainly have no intention to give to the term,
factor of production, any ethical connotation. Even
though a factor of production be, like land or labor, a <i>sine
qua non</i> of production, it does not follow that the owner of
that factor gets his proper, or ethically just share, under
the laws of economic imputation. Many of the "factors
of production," in the sense of factor which derives a value
from the economic laws of imputation, may well be parasitic
from the angle of ultimate social welfare. The only
test is as to whether, under existing social arrangements,
a portion of the income <i>of a given establishment</i> would cease
to exist if that factor should disappear, or be reduced.
From the angle of this test, monopoly power, trade-marks,
established trade connections, the big idea of an entrepreneur,
a dynamic personality, capacity for winning other
men's confidence and good will, and sometimes that brutal
selfishness which makes other men shrink from conflict, or
the reputation of being a dangerous and vindictive man,
may be equally "factors of production" with land, labor,
and produced instruments of production. In Part IV of
this book, "The Reconciliation of Statics and Dynamics,"
we have discussed the "intangible capital items" of this
class, and have indicated that many of them perform
really important and necessary social functions. Others
are doubtless pernicious. Production involves leadership,
organization, the making and maintaining of "interstitial
connections," as well as the technology of muscle and
machine. But credit is based on values, rather than on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
concrete goods as such, and if these "intangibles" have
value, they may have credits based upon them.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>That some of these values exist only by virtue of the
fact that credit is granted is no marked peculiarity. The
granting of credit is an exchange of the rights of the
creditor for rights to the future income of the borrower.
If the exchange were not made, in certain cases, the borrower
would have no future income to which he could give
rights. The entrepreneur with a big idea cannot actualize
that big idea unless he can bring it into conjunction with
land, labor, capital, and a market for the products. The
exchange of rights to the value of the products for the
banker's deposit-currency, or the private lender's money
is merely one of many necessary exchanges required to
bring about the combination which will create the products.
If there were no possibility of marketing the products, he
would be equally helpless, and his idea be equally valueless.
The general range of values, under our present system of
division of labor, private property, private enterprise, etc.,
depend on the possibility of exchange. Men produce for the
market, rather than for their own consumption, or for the
consumption of a communist society. Without exchange,
many values would persist, but most values would at
least be diminished. Exchange is part of the productive
process. The only peculiarity in the case under discussion
is that the man getting credit for the exploitation of a big
new idea commonly has a very limited market&mdash;is dependent
on the decision of one bank or lender, or at most of
one out of a few possibilities. The narrower the market,
the more dependent are the values of things that must be
exchanged upon the decisions of a few men. Wheat is
free, virtually, from individual caprices, though even there
a big operator may organize a pool and temporarily affect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>
the value very greatly. But the immediate power of a few
men on values is increasingly great as we get closer to those
things which are unique, which are capable of only specialized
employment, and which call for the co&ouml;peration of
elaborate and expensive systems. And, of course, the influence
of individual caprice, or individual decisions, on all
values grows greater as wealth and power are concentrated.
Economic social value is an institutional value, specially
weighted and controlled by individuals, classes and institutions.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>Joseph Schumpeter, in his <i>Theorie der wirtschaftlichen
Entwicklung</i>, has made much of the r&ocirc;le of the banker in
economic evolution. He sees in the banker a creator of
"<i>Kaufkraft</i>," by means of which an entrepreneur, a dynamic
man who has a new idea which he wishes to actualize, is
able to wrest from the unwilling "static economic subjects"
their land, labor and instrumental goods for the purpose of
putting his new plan through. This new <i>Kaufkraft</i> is the
true <i>Kapital</i> which the new enterprise requires. Capital,
thus defined, is not an accumulation of goods, is not embodied
in goods. It is an <i>agent</i>, a <i>power</i>, which the banker
creates. It makes dynamic change possible. Schumpeter
is particularly anxious, in clearing the way for his new
theory of interest, to get rid of all the notions of saving, accumulations
of stocks of goods, etc., which have commonly
been made prominent in the discussion of capital and interest.
We need not here discuss his theory of interest.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
He maintains that the new dynamic credit, credit granted
by a banker for a really new enterprise, as yet not concretely
in existence, represents something new in the world,
anomolous from the angle of static values, and static credit.
Indeed, he regards credit as unessential for the static
analysis, and banishes it from the "<i>Wesen</i>" of his static
state. But this new credit is different from such credit as
there may be in the static state, because, he holds, the new
credit does not rest on goods, and has no <i>Deckung</i>. Schumpeter
himself calls these doctrines "heresies." They become
less dangerous, however, when we learn that by
"saving" Schumpeter means mere trenching upon accustomed
expenditure, so that the entrepreneur who saves part
of unusual profits is really not saving at all, and when one
discovers that his contention that there need be no accumulation
of goods prior to the starting of a new enterprise
means merely that there need be no special accumulation
of goods <i>ad hoc</i>. Of course if saving means trenching upon
accustomed expenditure, it is banished by hypothesis from
the static state, but there may still be plenty of capital (in
the ordinary sense of accumulated produced means of production)
for Schumpeter's entrepreneur to get hold of by
means of his new <i>Kapital</i>. His contentions that the new
credit does not rest on goods, that it has no <i>Deckung</i>, and
that we have a new thing in the world since in dynamic
credit we have a case of temporal discrepancy between the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>making of obligations and the ability to pay them, calls for
further analysis.</p>

<p>It is true that there is a time during which the new credit
has no basis in concrete goods. Very speedily, however,
the new credit is exchanged for concrete goods, and the
enterprise is started. Further, the banker commonly insists
on a margin at the start. Further, the claims of the
borrower on the banker are themselves, prior to their expenditure
for the things needed in the enterprise, assets to
which the banker may look as a basis for his confidence in
the goodness of the entrepreneur's promise to pay him.
There is never a moment when the new credit does not rest
on <i>values</i>. The loan by the banker to the borrower is,
essentially, like the case of the purchase of any bearer of
future incomes, say a machine, or a factory. The machine
is, after all, in economic nature, merely a "promise" of
future goods and future values, as an Austrian economist
should be quick to recognize, and machines are almost as
frequently poor performers as borrowers&mdash;indeed, most
commonly, the borrower's inability to repay comes from the
failure in the value of the goods which his physical equipment
produces. The <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i> of the new credit is the
new values which have come into existence: the new plan
of the entrepreneur, <i>validated by the banker</i>, attains a value
equal to the present worth of the extra products which it
promises. I repeat that it is values which are significant
as the basis of loans, that values are not all embodied in
physical goods, and that value is essentially a psychological
thing.</p>

<p>The banker's validation of the plan may be an essential
factor in its value. <i>Belief</i> is often an essential factor in
values. The new value, and the new credit, have a large
element of belief in them. The value of the new plan rests
proximately in the belief of the banker, manifested by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
granting of credit. But the value of the <i>bank-credit</i> rests
ultimately in the <i>prestige</i> of the banker, which is a fact of
social psychology, resting in a massing of belief on the part
of the public in him, in the validity of his bank-notes and
deposit-currency, coupled with support from legal and
other institutions. But this is to anticipate the discussion
of the nature of bank-credit. The point involved is sufficiently
illustrated by the case where a man who is not a
banker lends his money to an entrepreneur of a new undertaking.
Here again the enterprise is impossible without
the loan. Here the loan is made on the basis of an anticipated
income. Here again the anticipated income is made
possible only by the loan; one of the values that enters into
the exchange exists only because the exchange is possible.
None the less, the credit rests on value. It is a right to an
anticipated income. The man who has made the loan has
his security in the value which he has lent, plus the present
worth of the extra income which the new idea is expected
to create.</p>

<p>Now a great practical difference is made in the course of
economic life by the decisions of lenders to lend to men who
plan new things, instead of to men who plan old things. It
makes an enormous difference whether or not new plans
appeal to the imaginations of those who control the economic
resources of society. It makes a great difference
whether static values (the capital values of incomes to be
created in familiar ways) or dynamic values (capital values
of incomes to be created in novel ways) win out in the competition
for loans from those who have loans to make. But
<i>as values</i>, the two are of the same psychological stuff and
substance: futurity and belief are essential elements in both
of them.</p>

<p>Stable belief, and strong belief, are easier to evoke in the
case of the established and the familiar. New ways of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
creating wealth must promise larger returns, and make
more dramatic appeals to the imagination, than old ways.
Schumpeter indicates that it is the essential function of the
banker to give preference to the new ways, that the mass
of men are "static" in their attitude, and that, for some
reason which he does not clearly indicate, the banker is
not. This has not been our American experience, on the
whole. The contrast which Schumpeter makes between
the timid, static masses, and the few highly important
dynamic entrepreneurs, holds very much less true in
America than in Continental Europe. There it is doubtless
true that new industrial enterprises have had their
main encouragement from bankers. Here, such enterprises
have appealed largely to the mass of men, to
the investing and speculative public. Our commercial
banks have lent largely upon stock exchange collateral,
which means that, indirectly, bank-loans have gone to
finance industry. The extent of this is enormous, as will
later appear. However, the banks, as banks, have not
been large <i>buyers</i> of stocks. They have guarded themselves
by requiring "margins" from those to whom they
have lent on such collateral. Seasoned bonds have been
bought in great volume by our commercial banks, but few
stocks. Even the underwriters and investment bankers
have been primarily intermediaries, expecting to pass on to
private buyers the securities they hold temporarily. My
point here is, merely, that there is nothing in the distinction
between static and dynamic credit, when by that is meant
the distinction between credit for new enterprises and credit
for old enterprises, to mark off a peculiar or essential province
for bank-credit. The need for bank-credit does arise
out of dynamic conditions, primarily, but it is not the need
for credit to <i>start</i> dynamic changes, even though bank-credit
may do, and does do, that. The chief reason for bank<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>-credit is to enable economic society to readjust itself
quickly and readily to dynamic changes, by putting through
without friction the necessary exchanges that such readjustment
requires, and by holding in liquid form a fund of
rights which can meet the emergencies and unexpected
occurrences which dynamic conditions involve. To this
we now turn.</p>

<p>Bank-credit is the debt of responsible institutions, payable
on demand in money. It may take the form of notes,
or of the right to draw checks. Long evolution has begot
a system of legal relationships, and of banking technique
which makes these promises easily performed. The same
process of development has led to social reactions toward
banks and bankers which give them enormous prestige.
Legal regulation, in the case of many banks, requiring
adequate capital, and, in this country, requiring minimum
cash reserves, have added to that prestige. The promise
of the bank is commonly so liquid and saleable that the
banks are not called upon to fulfill it by the actual payment
of money&mdash;the promise alone is an object of value which is
perfectly saleable, which runs in terms of money, and
which functions as a perfect substitute for money in almost
every use except for very small retail transactions. Even
there, it is very much used.</p>

<p>Among the features of banking technique to which we
must give especial attention are the following: (1) the
banker has substantial resources of his own, his "capital,"
which constitutes the "margin" of protection which he
offers to those who give him valuable things in return for
his promises to pay money on demand; (2) the banker exchanges
his promises to pay on demand, as far as possible,
for those things which have a high degree of "liquidity,"
<i>i. e.</i>, for those things which he can quickly dispose of for
cash, or for the promises of other bankers which are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
equivalent of cash. Farm mortgages are not good assets
for a banker to hold in large amount. They are long-term
obligations, with a very limited market, and they will not
help him in emergencies to meet his obligations to pay on
demand. Agricultural loans, and other mortgage loans
are made in considerable volume by our State banks and
trust companies. All classes of commercial banks make
many non-liquid loans, as we shall later see. But all of
them get as high a proportion of liquid loans as they can.
Bills of exchange, running ten, thirty, sixty or ninety days,
growing out of commercial transactions which automatically
terminate themselves in the payment of cash or the
promises of other bankers, constitute admirable assets.
In return for these, the banker may give his promises
freely. This is especially true where there is, in the banking
practice, a wide "rediscount market," in which he can
sell these bills before maturity if he wishes to get even more
liquid assets. Promissory notes, for short periods, thirty,
sixty, or ninety days, growing again out of commercial
transactions, which, like those for which the bills of exchange
were drawn, automatically bring in cash or the
promises of other banks, are in many respects like the bills
of exchange, even though the rediscount market for such
notes has not been so highly developed as the market for
bills of exchange in Europe. Whether such notes are as
available for rediscount as bills of exchange is a question of
technical banking which we need not here discuss in detail,
though I venture the opinion that bills of exchange are
superior decidedly for this purpose, especially "documentary"
bills. The element of personal credit is commonly
larger in the promissory note, and that limits the market.
Banking organization, and particularly our new Federal
Reserve System, may greatly reduce the disadvantages of
the promissory note from this angle, but it seems not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
unlikely that the bill of exchange may be a factor of increasing
importance in our internal banking arrangements.
The general test, however, of what is available for a banker's
assets depends on varying conditions, and is not to be
answered by a simple formula. A bank in a rural region
which loads up heavily with the safest local bonds is little
better off than with farm mortgages. For neither is there
a quick market in an emergency. A city bank, near the
stock exchange, may very safely buy in large amounts
highly saleable as a profitable substitute for part of its cash
reserve. Even country banks may, and do, safely own
such bonds. Short loans on stock and bond security, constitute
the most important single type of bank-loan in the
United States, as we shall later see. (3) The third feature
of banking technique to which attention must be given is
the reserve policy. The banker must keep some actual
money on hand (how much we have in part considered in
Part II, and shall again discuss).</p>

<p>I shall give attention to these points in what follows.
The first point needs little discussion. Large "capital"
for a bank gives prestige and security. Some capital is a
<i>sine qua non</i> for a bank which expects its notes or deposit
currency to have general acceptability.</p>

<p>It will be well to consider further the circumstances
determining the form which a bank's assets shall take.
Though commercial banks own enormous quantities of high
grade bonds, it is rare for commercial banks in America to
buy stocks of corporations.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> They will often lend to owners
of such stocks with the stocks as collateral, up to a high
percentage of the value of the stocks, but they will rarely
trade their demand obligations for the stocks directly. In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
general, a bank wishes to have its assets in the form of
obligations of other people, expressed in terms of dollars,
and having a definite term to run (or callable on demand).</p>

<p>One reason for this is a bookkeeping reason. "Par value"
of stocks has little meaning any more. Market-prices of
stocks, even the best stocks, are not absolutely fixed. They
fluctuate, even though within narrow limits. This fact
presents complications to the bookkeeper! Of course, the
bank's buildings and fixtures, listed among its assets, fluctuate
also, in value, and in the price that could be obtained
on a given day, but the bookkeeper can abstract from that,
since the bank has no intention of selling its buildings and
fixtures. The notes and bills held in the bank's portfolios
also in fact fluctuate in value, and in the price at which
they might be sold on a given day, but they are expressed
in terms of dollars, and the bookkeeper commonly has no
need to look beyond the figures written on them. At irregular
intervals, a small percentage of them may be marked
off the books as "bad," but usually the minor fluctuations
are abstracted from. The bank does not like to have assets
whose published prices fluctuate. But this is, I suppose,
not the main objection which banks have to stocks as assets
since it does not prevent their buying bonds. I abstract
from the legal restrictions that prevent many banks from
buying stocks. The fundamental reason is to be found
elsewhere. The point is to be found here: the transaction
whereby property rights in roadbed, rolling stock, etc.,
were collected into property rights in a going, organic
whole increased the saleability of all these rights; the further
subdivision of these rights into many thousands of equal
parts enormously increased the saleability of these rights,
especially when coupled with listing in an organized market;
the further transaction, by which a preferential claim upon
these subdivisions of rights is embodied in a collateral note<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
still further increases the saleability of the value of these
rights. The whole of the value embodied in a share of
stock has not the certainty and saleability which a banker
wishes for his assets. It might not be possible to market
the stock on a given day without loss. But a collateral
note, embodying 80% of that value, with provision for
additional collateral in case the margin is reduced, is highly
liquid and the banker has no doubt that, with watchfulness,
he can always realize the full face value of such a note. It
becomes saleable enough for his purposes. The transaction
by which this note is exchanged for the banker's demand
obligation gives the drawer of the collateral note a
perfectly saleable form of value with an almost universal
market, which he can convert without loss into practically
anything that money can buy. We have here a series, a
scale, saleability of rights growing steadily greater, through
a series of transformations and exchanges, till at last the
virtually perfect saleability is reached. Again we are reminded
of Menger's analysis<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> of the methods of primitive
barter, whereby the man who possesses a good of low saleability,
through successive exchanges, gradually gets goods
of higher and higher saleability, until he finally reaches his
goal. Bank-credit, this most highly saleable of all forms of
rights except the rights to actual money in hand, and in
general not inferior to money, cannot usually be had by
direct offer to the bank of crude property rights. These
must be refined and distilled, till a central core of highly
saleable value emerges, and then they may enter the bank's
assets in return for bank-credit. The best bonds likewise
offer such a central core of highly saleable value.</p>

<p>A further point is to be noticed about this scale of saleabilities.
At each stage of the exchanges of less saleable
for more saleable rights, the holder of the less saleable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
rights must make concessions to the holder of the more
saleable rights. And the degree of his concession is, in
general, correlated with the lack of saleability of what he
offers. Commonly this takes the form of giving up a right
which has a higher yield for one which has a lower yield.
Or, viewed more fundamentally, from the angle of the
capitalization theory, income-bearers of low saleability
are capitalized at a higher discount rate than income-bearers
of higher saleability, with the same yield. Farm lands
may be capitalized on a 10% basis. (There will be great
differences between regions in this, depending in considerable
measure, often, on the activity of farm sales. I would
refer here to the facts mentioned in my chapter on "The
Quantity Theory and International Gold Movements,"
contrasting Cass Co., Iowa, with Yazoo Co., Mississippi.
Of course, the risks of agriculture count heavily, also, and
the prestige of owning land as compared with other forms
of property.) The farmer's mortgage note may bear 7%.
A merchant who holds that note may use it as collateral,
with a margin, backing his own note, and get accommodation
for three months at 6%. The bank may rediscount
the note of the merchant, giving it its own endorsement, on
a 4&frac12;% basis. The coal mine owned by a small company
may yield 12%; sold to a large iron company, which combines
mining and smelting and manufacturing, that mine
may be represented by 7% stock; a collateral loan, for
sixty days, based on 80% of the value of the stock may be
had for 4%; the demand liability of the bank given in exchange
for the collateral note will either yield nothing at
all, or else yield a low per cent, one, one and a half, or 2%,
on large checking accounts. If the collateral note be a call
note, the rate will be lower, in general, than on a time note.
I here refer to what was said in the chapter on the functions
of money with reference to the relation of short loans, es<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>pecially
call loans, to the "bearer of options" function of
money. Part of the yields of these loans is in the bearing
of options. This function grows out of the uncertainties
of a dynamic market. It would disappear if uncertainties,
"friction," and dangers disappeared.</p>

<p>The importance of liquidity and saleability in the assets
of a banker needs little discussion. It has been reiterated
by virtually every writer on the subject. Its connection
with the need for meeting demand obligations is obvious.
The point that I would here emphasize is, however, that
this, too, grows out of dynamic changes, uncertainties, etc.
An economic life in "normal equilibrium," in static balance,
with all things going smoothly, in anticipated ways, could
dispense in large measure, or wholly, with such liquidity.
Obligations which matured at the time that the holders of
the obligations had maturing obligations, would serve their
purpose perfectly. Again I would emphasize the fact that
the theory of money and bank-credit is essentially a dynamic
theory, and that the notion of "normal equilibrium"
which underlies the quantity theory has no bearing whatever
on these fundamental matters.</p>

<p>The market where fluid bank-credit is exchanged for less
fluid rights has been given the name, "the money market."
The prices fixed in this market are "money-rates," figured
as percentages on the amounts of bank-credit exchanged
for the less fluid rights. It is, of course, strictly speaking,
not a money market. Money, as the term has been used
in this book, has been taken to mean gold coin, subsidiary
coin, government paper, and for the United States, bank-notes.
In a country where much bank-credit is elastic
bank-notes, it is better to distinguish money from bank-notes.
The term, money, is not one easily defined in a logical
manner. A good logical definition should seize on some
essential characteristic of the object defined, should in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>clude
all the objects of that class, and should exclude all
others. We can meet the tests of inclusiveness and exclusiveness
in a definition of money, but we can hardly meet
the first test. The differences between gold money, for example,
and gold bullion are less than the differences between
gold money and government paper. The differences
between bank-notes and bank-deposits are less than the
differences between bank-notes and government paper, or
bank-notes and gold. The term, money, covers a group of
more or less miscellaneous things, concerning all of which few
general laws are possible. Gold, or other standard money,
in particular, may obey different laws from other forms of
money. I have been careful, in the foregoing, to avoid
the danger of letting the argument rest on any ambiguity
in the meaning of the term, however, and for the present
shall not attempt further definition. For the present, we
shall use the term, "money market," in its familiar sense,
as meaning that market in which bank-credit is exchanged
for less fluid rights. An organized money market commonly
appears only in larger cities. In smaller places,
relationships between banks and customers are much more
personal, and indeed, even in larger cities, regular business
houses have particularly intimate relations with special
banks. A fluid, impersonal market, to which men may
repair without reference to anything but the marketability
of the collateral they have to offer, is a distinctively metropolitan
affair. Only large dealers commonly have relations
with more than one or two banks. Larger houses in the
big cities often do sell their "commercial paper" through
brokers, and some of the big New York mercantile houses
have had their paper scattered a good deal throughout the
country. The lack of protection which houses which
sought such credit faced during the Panic of 1907 tended to
check the practice in some measure, but it has revived, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
even increased.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> In the matter of a wide market for commercial
paper, however, an impersonal market, with great
fluidity, we are well behind not only England, but also
Continental Europe. The London acceptance house has
especially contributed to an impersonal market. The
American money market is <i>par excellence</i> a New York
market, and the primary type of paper discounted in the
American money market is stock exchange paper, and
foreign bills of exchange. For commercial paper, however,
there are innumerable more personal, more restricted,
markets, and commercial paper constitutes a very considerable
part of banking assets, though much less than is often
supposed. But this we shall discuss in the next chapter.</p>

<p>In traditional discussions of banking, the impression is
given that commercial paper is the normal and dominant
type of banking assets.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> To one accustomed to this view,

<p>These figures, however, call for further analysis. They
include figures from institutions which should not be
counted with commercial banks. The percentage of real<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
estate loans, especially, is too high to represent the workings
of commercial banks, a very high percentage of real
estate loans being held by stock and mutual savings banks.
The other items, however, are not much changed by the
inclusion of savings banks and private banks. It will be
well to draw some conclusions from these aggregate figures
for all classes of institutions, before taking up a more detailed
analysis of State and national banks, and trust companies.</p>

<p>Where, among these items, does one find "commercial
paper"? In the reports of the metropolitan papers, giving
daily variations in interest rates, it is usual to find "commercial
paper" listed as a separate category, co&ouml;rdinate
with "sixty day paper," "ninety day paper," etc. Recent
periodical discussion has gone elaborately into the question
as to what should be called "commercial paper," from the
standpoint of the policy of the Federal Reserve Banks.
I think it safe to say that no two markets, at present, in the
United States will use the term in precisely the same way,
and that all would restrict the term to a small portion of
the "other loans and discounts" listed above. The most
general definition of "commercial paper" would be paper
bought through note-brokers. Despite the decided increase
in loans and discounts which our war prosperity has
involved, there has been very frequent complaint of the
scarcity of "commercial paper." I shall use the term,
"commercial paper" in a much more liberal sense than the
American money market does, and shall mean by it all
loans of a really liquid character, made by banks to merchants
and others to pay for the purchase of goods in anticipation
of a resale within the term of the loan which will
enable the loan to be repaid at maturity. From this
should be excluded, however, loans made to speculators.
With this liberal, and not very precise, definition of com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>mercial
paper, we raise again the question as to where it may
be found in the items above given.</p>

<p>Virtually all of it, I think, must be found in the item,
"other loans and discounts"&mdash;an item which, in all, is
slightly less than 23% of total banking assets.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> But not
all of this "other loans and discounts" is commercial paper.
Very much indeed represents loans of a non-liquid character,
regularly renewed, which manufacturers and others
have put, not into moveable goods, but into fixed forms of
capital-goods, as machinery, and even buildings. One case
in New York, which the writer is informed by a business
man well acquainted with both banking and business in
many sections of the country is typical of many cases, is as
follows: a New York bank is at present lending to a small
manufacturer of automobile supplies about $30,000. Of
this, about $10,000 is liquid, periodically covered by "bills
receivable," and if the bills receivable should fail, in the
period in question, to cover the $10,000, the bank would
insist on a reduction of the loan. The remaining $20,000,
however, is not liquid. It was spent for non-moveable
equipment; the bank expects to renew the notes for this
loan periodically, and is well aware that it could not force
collection without bringing the business to a close&mdash;or else
forcing the factory to get accommodation elsewhere. The
$10,000 that is liquid is by no means all spent for goods,
but is spent, in part, for wages. <i>None</i> of the $10,000 is
spent for goods which are to be resold without being transformed
by manufacture. None of the $30,000, therefore,
is, in the strict sense, "commercial paper." It is manufacturer's
paper. Part of it is virtually as liquid as commercial
paper; two-thirds of it is not liquid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span></p>

<p>A very large part indeed of bank-loans are of this character.
A large part of the loans made to farmers are in no
sense liquid: when the loan is made, for, say, six months,<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a>
it is perfectly understood by both bank and borrower that a
renewal will be asked for and granted. It is impossible to
say what fraction of this $4,821,000,000 of "other loans
and discounts" is really liquid commercial paper, or liquid
paper of any kind, in the sense that it can be automatically
paid off at maturity. I venture the statement with entire
confidence, however, that the proportion of liquid paper is
not one-half of the amount. I should question if more
than one-fourth of it is truly liquid, in the sense in which
that term is commonly used: meaning that the loan is made
to put through a transaction which will be completed during
the term of the loan, and permit the loan automatically to
be paid off. I do not mean by this merely that the banks
could not reduce this item by one-fourth suddenly. Even
in a market made up wholly of highly liquid paper, an
arbitrary refusal to renew one-fourth of the loans, with the
effort to reduce loans and discounts by one-fourth, would
occasion great embarrassment and even disaster. The
test of liquidity here applied relates to the items separately,
on the assumption that other things are not radically
changed. Even in this sense, however, viewing each loan
transaction separately, it may well be questioned if the
banks in the United States could find among their "other
loans and discounts" items exceeding a fourth of the total
(in value) which they could refuse to renew, at least in large
part, without disappointing reasonable expectations, and
embarrassing good business men.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>Of
this paper, not truly liquid, no doubt a good deal is
advanced to wholesale and retail merchants, and is, in this
sense, commercial paper. The terms, "liquid paper" and
"commercial paper" by no means run on all fours! As
will later appear, the bulk of liquid banking assets are not
commercial paper at all. And only that part of a bank's
loans to a merchant may be called "liquid" which can be
paid off by the merchant without disappointing his reasonable
expectations,&mdash;causing him to seek other banking
connections.</p>

<p>There is, however, another item in which we may find
some commercial paper, and this is the item, "loans on
other collateral security." This has commonly been supposed
to be virtually all stock exchange loans. Thus,
Conant<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> cites the growth in this item in New York as evidence
of the growth of loans on stocks and bonds. For
New York, loans on stocks and bonds do make up the great
bulk of this item. Even in New York, however, there are
other factors in it, absolutely, even though not relatively,
important, and in the country outside, the other elements
are not at all negligible, even though for the outside country
the part secured by stocks and bonds is the major part, and
even though the growth of this item in our total banking
assets is, in general, fairly indicative of the growth of loans
secured by stocks and bonds. Figures for the other items
are not available for State banks, trust companies or savings
and private banks. They are not till very recently
available for national banks. In 1915,<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> however, the
Comptroller separates the item, "loans on other collateral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
security," for national banks, into two parts, (1) loans "secured
by stocks and bonds" ($1,750,597,273), and (2) loans
"secured by other personal securities, including merchandise,
warehouse receipts, etc." ($882,749,812). Is there
any commercial paper in this last, not inconsiderable, item?</p>

<p>Let us locate the item, in the effort to find out. The
percentage runs highest in Chicago, where this class of collateral
loan exceeds the loans on stocks and bonds. The
inference is strongly suggested, therefore, that much of it,
there, at least, represents advances to live-stock, grain and
produce traders and speculators on the Board of Trade, at
the stock yards, etc. The inference is strengthened by
the fact that St. Louis, where there is a good deal of
grain and commodity speculation, shows more than
twice as much of this kind of paper as does Boston,
where this kind of speculation is unimportant&mdash;despite
the fact that Boston's aggregate collateral loans of all
kinds greatly exceed such loans in St. Louis. In New
York, where there is a great deal of coffee and cotton
speculation, and some other commodity speculation, the
amount of this paper, though relatively small, is absolutely
greater than in any other city. No doubt, in New
York, which is the country's centre for foreign commerce, a
fair amount of the paper secured by "other personal securities,
including merchandise, warehouse receipts, etc.," is
really commercial paper, representing advances to importers
and exporters&mdash;though the difficulties of giving this kind of
security where goods are in transit would prevent most
of our foreign trade being financed in this manner. The
total of this kind of paper in New York&mdash;all these figures
are for national banks alone&mdash;was only 113 millions on
June 23, 1915.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> It may be doubted if very much of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
paper, in the great cities, represents goods in transit. With
the caution that the view here expressed is based on inference,
and not on actual knowledge of what the large
city banks are doing, the writer concludes that probably
the bulk of this paper, in large cities, represents loans to
speculators rather than to merchants. It is liquid, but it
is not commercial paper.</p>

<p>What of such paper in the country districts? Nearly
one-half&mdash;$436,000,000 out of $882,000,000&mdash;of these national
bank-loans on "other personal security, including
merchandise, warehouse receipts, etc.," are in the country,
outside the Reserve and Central Reserve Cities. Much of
it is in the South. Much of it in the grain and live-stock
producing regions. What do such loans mean?<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Much
of it is loans to farmers and planters. In the South, much
of it is on crop liens. The loans on cotton warehouse receipts,
at least in the country parts of the South, are not as
great as is commonly supposed. In the North and West,
there are a great mass of farmers' chattel mortgage loans,
including loans on horses, grain in cribs, hogs, sheep, cattle,
mules, etc. The use of this type of paper for financing the
breeding and feeding of live-stock, particularly hogs, cattle
and sheep, is very extensive. Virtually all loans to farmers
and feeders for these purposes are secured by such chattel
mortgages. It seems improbable that a great deal of this
paper could represent ordinary commerce. Neither wholesalers
nor retailers can easily handle merchandise on which
chattel mortgages have been given. The usual method of
granting credit to them is to advance loans on one and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
two name paper, unsecured. Not many loans to retailers
and wholesalers will fall in the category under
discussion.</p>

<p>To what extent are the loans of this type to farmers
liquid? Well, the crop lien loans in the South have a natural
term, and, though commonly longer loans than bankers
have in mind when speaking of liquid paper, are liquid in
the sense that they are automatically paid off at maturity.
Loans on work-animals need not have a natural term.
Loans on animals being fed for the market have such a
natural term, and are truly liquid. Loans, however, on
breeding animals are not thus liquid, such loans are commonly
regularly renewed at maturity, and the banks do
not count on them in emergencies. It is the opinion of Dr.
J. E. Pope that fully two-thirds of the aggregate loans on
live-stock chattel mortgage security are to breeders rather
than to feeders, and hence are not liquid. Of course, none
of these loans are commercial paper.</p>

<p>I conclude, therefore, that the thesis with which we
started that the overwhelming bulk of commercial paper is
to be found in the item, "other loans and discounts" is
correct. I see no reason to suppose that an analysis of the
loans of State banks and trust companies would show a
different conclusion. We lack the figures for breaking up
the collateral loans of State banks and trust companies into
the two classes, "secured by stocks and bonds" and "secured
by other personal securities, including warehouse receipts,
merchandise, etc." We have merely the gross
figures for collateral loans. As the State banks are in large
degree country banks, it is probable that the percentage of
commodity collateral as compared with stock exchange collateral
for State banks would be larger than for national
banks. However, the total of collateral loans for State
banks is relatively small&mdash;559 millions, for 1909, as against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
"other loans and discounts" for State banks in that year of
1,112 millions, and as against a total of collateral loans of
all banks reporting in that year of 3,975 millions. On the
other hand, the collateral loans of the trust companies are
very large: 1,222 millions for 1909, as against "other loans
and discounts" for the trust companies in the same year of
460 millions. As the trust companies are chiefly city institutions,
and as the concentration of trust company loans
and capital in New York City is relatively very great, it
would seem pretty clear that taking both State banks and
trust companies into account would substantially lessen the
percentage of loans "secured by other personal security,
including merchandise, warehouse receipts, etc.," to total
collateral loans. As the amount of commercial paper in
this class of loans for national banks is probably small, it
may be expected to be still smaller in the aggregate of collateral
loans.</p>

<p>The following figures, for State and national banks, and
trust companies, only, will, in the light of the foregoing,
give us basis for some further conclusions regarding the
character of banking assets in the United States. As before,
the year 1909 is chosen:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span></p>

<p>This table makes clear that the figures for real estate
loans given in the table for all banks, a few pages preceding,
were much too high. It leaves the relations among
the other items, however, not greatly changed. "All
other loans" increase from slightly less than 23% of total
assets to 27%. If we concede that one-half of the "all
other loans" represents liquid "commercial paper"&mdash;a very
liberal estimate, as we have previously concluded&mdash;we get
about 13&frac12;% of the assets of these institutions in the
form of "commercial paper," an increase over the 11&frac12;%
to be assigned on the basis of the other table. The
figure is the roughest sort of approximation. I attach
little importance to the exact percentage, and the argument
which follows is not dependent on any exact figure here.
The proportion of collateral loans to total resources is
changed also, and even more: collateral loans are 18% of
total bank resources when all kinds of banks are included,
and are over 22% of total bank resources when only State
and national banks and trust companies are counted. If
the foregoing is correct within very wide limits of error as
to the amount of commercial paper, collateral loans very
substantially exceed commercial paper. If all the "all
other loans" should be counted as commercial paper, collateral
loans are still not far behind them&mdash;22% as against
27&frac12;%.</p>

<p>What is the significance of this? We have seen that for
national banks, the great bulk (over 66%) of the collateral
loans were secured by stocks and bonds in June, 1915. We
saw reasons for supposing that a higher percentage of stock
exchange collateral would be found when State banks and
trust companies are included. Suppose we assume that 75%
of the collateral loans of all three classes of institutions here
in question are based on stock exchange collateral.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
would mean 16&frac12;% of the total resources of these institutions
in stock exchange loans&mdash;still well above the 13&frac12;%
we have assigned to "commercial paper." In any case, it is
at least justifiable to contend that loans on stock exchange
collateral are as great in volume as commercial loans. I
think that they very substantially exceed them. But further,
we have another large percentage of bank resources
invested in stock exchange securities outright&mdash;chiefly in
bonds. The aggregate for those investments in the institutions
under consideration is 3,250 millions. This is something
over 19% of the total assets of these institutions.
Combining this with the loans on stock exchange collateral,
we get nearly 36% of bank and trust company assets invested,
directly or indirectly, in stock exchange securities, as
against an assumed 13&frac12;% in commercial paper. Conceding
that all the "all other loans" are commercial loans, the
stock exchange assets still exceed them in the ratio of 36
to 27&frac12;.</p>

<p>In our second table, we have listed items which aggregate
only 12,456 millions of the total resources for these institutions
of 16,774 millions. The items listed, however,
represent virtually all the credit extended by banks to industry,
commerce, agriculture, the stock market, other
speculation, and the State. The excluded items of main
importance are: Due from other banks and bankers, 2,302
millions; checks and other cash items, 432 millions; and
cash on hand, 1,411 millions&mdash;the three items aggregating
4,146 millions, which virtually closes the gap. These three
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>items are of immense importance as making for liquidity
in banking assets, and as making possible extensions of
credit to the business world, but it is not proper to count
them when an estimate of the extent of bank-credits is in
question. Our second table contains, for the three classes
of institutions, all the items properly counted there, except
overdrafts (small in amount) and one other big item which
does not get into bank statements at all, namely, <i>overcertifications</i>
and "<i>morning loans</i>." Of this last item, more
later. We may, then, recalculate our percentages on the
basis of the credit extended by the three classes of institutions,
instead of on the basis of total resources. On this
basis, the percentages are:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Real estate loans, 7.4%;</p>

<p>Collateral loans, 30%, of which we assign to stock exchange
collateral, 22&frac12;%, and to other collateral, 7&frac12;%;</p>

<p>All other loans, 36.4%, of which we assign to "Commercial paper"
18.2%;</p>

<p>Total stocks and bonds, 26%.</p></div>

<p>Adding the percentages for stock exchange collateral loans
and for stocks and bonds owned, we get 48&frac12;% of all extensions
of bank-credit for these three classes of institutions
in the form of credits extended to the security market. If
everything else except the real estate loans should be
counted as "commercial loans" the stock exchange credit
would still exceed the commercial credit. If my estimate
of 18.2% of bank-credit based on commercial paper is high
enough,<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> the banks and trust companies have extended over
two and a half times as much credit, at a given time, to the
security market as they have to commerce. This on the
face of the record. But there is, as above indicated, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
further item which does not get into the record, namely,
overcertifications and "morning loans." Every day in the
great speculative centres, and very especially in Wall Street,
enormous advances are made to brokers, which are canceled
during the day, but which, during their short life, are a real
addition to bank-credit. To attempt to estimate this with
any accuracy is hopeless, but the total on any ordinary day
is enormous, and most of it is extended in connection with
stock market transactions.</p>

<p>A final comparison,<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> which will conclude this perhaps too
wearisome analysis of these figures, will consider the loans
alone, neglecting the securities owned:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Of total loans:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Real estate loans, 9.3%;</p>

<p>Collateral loans, 40.8%, of which we assign to stock
exchange collateral, 30.6%, and to other collateral,
10.2%;</p>

<p>All other loans, 49.6%, of which we assign to "Commercial
paper," 24.8%.</p></div>

<p>The development of bank loans on stock exchange collateral
is a remarkable feature of the three or four decades
preceding 1909. The following figures, of national bank
loans in New York City,<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> illustrate the tendency:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span></p>

<p>We conclude, therefore, that the great bulk of banking
credit in the United States, even of "commercial banks,"
is not commercial credit. Much of it, in the smaller places,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
especially, represents in fact, whatever the form, long time
advances to agriculture and industry. Most of it, in the
great cities, and to a large extent in even the smaller places,
represents advances to the permanent financing of corporate
industry. Excluding real estate loans, more than half of
bank-credit represents either ownership of bonds (with
some stocks) or else advances on stocks and bonds. Another
important part of bank-credit, which I shall not even
attempt to measure, is employed in financing commodity
speculation.</p>

<p>It is worth while to compare our figures concerning bank
loans with Kinley's figures, which we have previously considered,
for deposits made on March 16 of 1909, the year
we have chosen for the bank loans figures. It is important
to remember that "deposits," as used by Kinley in this investigation,
does not mean what the term means in a bank
balance sheet. Kinley's figures relate to the actual items
deposited on the day in question, and not to the net balance
after deposits and withdrawals have been compared when
the bank has closed for the day. A large deposit in the
balance sheet sense might show no "deposits" in Kinley's
sense, in a given day; while enormous "deposits" in Kinley's
sense might be so offset by incoming checks that virtually
nothing is left on the balance sheet at the end of the
day, for a given depositor. Kinley's figures thus give us a
means of getting at the degree of <i>activity</i> of different classes
of deposits in the balance sheet sense, and so, indirectly, of
different classes of <i>loans</i>.</p>

<p>Loans and deposits (in the balance sheet sense) are, as we
know, closely correlated. This is true for banks in the
aggregate, and for banks individually at a moment of time.
It is not generally true of a given individual deposit account
at a moment of time, but through a period of time,
for business deposits, it tends to be true that the items de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>posited
offset the amounts borrowed.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> If the items deposited
are numerous, if the depositor has an "active" deposit
account, receiving a large flow of banking funds, as
compared with his net deposit balances, we may infer that
his loans are also active, that he pays off loans frequently,
that his paper, in the assets of the bank, is "liquid."</p>

<p>I need not give the details of Kinley's figures again, as
they have been elaborately analyzed in connection with
the estimate of the "volume of trade."<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> The figures show
that retail and wholesale deposits between them make up
about 25% of the total deposits. This would serve to
show that "commercial paper," which we have allowed to
be about 24.8 of total loans, is slightly more active (and
hence "liquid") than the average of loans.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> It will also
suggest, however, that our figure for "commercial paper,"
truly liquid, is too high, since we should expect this kind of
paper to be more active than the average&mdash;unless, indeed,
stock exchange collateral loans are so exceedingly active as
to make a tremendously high average. I refrain from trying
to get a definite answer on this point, since there are
many indeterminate elements: among others, uncertainty
as to the extent to which wholesale deposits and retail deposits
<i>include</i> all commercial deposits, and uncertainty as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
to the extent to which they <i>exclude</i> manufacturer's deposits.
The great bulk of Kinley's deposits, however, fall into the
"all other" class, and the great bulk of the "all other deposits"
are located in the great financial and speculative
centres, particularly New York. We have concluded that
they represent chiefly (a) transactions in securities; (b)
other speculation; (c) loan and other financial transactions,
particularly the shifting of call loans on stock exchange
collateral. It is, then, the deposits of those connected with
the great financial and speculative markets, particularly
the stock market, whose deposits are most active, and whose
loans are most liquid. Stock market collateral loans thus
constitute the most perfectly satisfactory sort of bank loan,
from the standpoint of liquidity. Though such loans do
not make up the bulk of bank loans (we have concluded
that they constitute 30.6% of the loans of State and national
banks and trust companies in 1909), they do account
for the bulk of banking activity, and supply the greatest
part of the liquidity of total bank loans.</p>

<p>When we consider further the item of securities (chiefly
bonds) in banking assets, we find another highly important
source of liquidity. The sales of bonds in the great banking
centres are enormous. The figures of bond sales on the
exchanges do not begin to tell the story. One big bank in
New York in 1911 sold more than half as many bonds as
were sold in that year on the floor of the Stock Exchange.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a>
It has been frequently stated that ten bonds, of those listed
on the Exchange are sold over the counter for one on the
floor. This is truer of Boston than New York. The "outside
market" for unlisted bonds is a very important matter.
Dealings among banks in these items and in foreign
exchange are exceedingly important. This is especially true
of the business of the great private bankers, as Morgan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
Kuhn-Loeb and others. Much of this does not appear in
Kinley's figures, since neither the deposits of the great
private banks in other banks, nor the deposits made in the
private banks themselves (so far as New York City is concerned)
figure in his totals.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Had they been included, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
percentage of the "all other deposits" would have grown,
and we should have had still more impressive evidence of
the fact that modern banking in the United States is largely
bound up with the security market, and that modern bank-credit
gets its liquidity chiefly from that source.</p>

<p>The story is even more impressively told by the figures
for bank clearings, which include the transactions between
banks, and the transactions of the private bankers. In
New York, in 1909, total clearings for the year were 104
billions, as against 62 billions for the whole country outside
New York.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> That bank clearings are closely correlated
with stock exchange transactions, has been demonstrated
fully by N. J. Silberling, who has shown the following correlations:
New York Stock Exchange share sales with New
York clearings, r = .718; total clearings for the country with
New York share sales, r = .607; total clearings for the
country with railway gross receipts (as representative of
ordinary trade), r = .356.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> The active deposits and the
liquid loans are chiefly connected with activities in finance
and speculation.</p>

<p>Now two important practical conclusions are suggested
by this analysis. The first is that the complaint of many
farmers, merchants, politicians, and even scientific writers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
that too much money and bank-credit are at the disposal
of Wall Street and other speculators rests on a misunderstanding
of causal relations. Wall Street does not, by
using a large amount of bank-credit, take just that much
away from ordinary business. Rather, it increases the
amount available for ordinary business! Wall Street, and
the other financial and speculative centres, supply the
<i>liquidity</i> for bank assets, and so make possible loans on
non-liquid paper. Banks do not need to have all their
assets liquid. If they did, American banks would have
long since gone under! The foregoing discussion of loans
to farmers, and manufacturers and even merchants should
have made that clear. But banks do need a substantial
margin of liquidity, to protect the rest. They get it from
stock exchange collateral loans, and from ownership of
listed and easily marketable bonds, primarily. They get
part of it from true commercial paper. Thus, the director
of a country bank in Iowa told the writer that banks in his
section&mdash;where banks owned in large measure by farmers,
and dealing largely with farmers, are very numerous and
important&mdash;make a regular practice of buying, through
brokers, a considerable amount of notes of outside merchants.
They do this to protect themselves. Their other
loans, to farmers, while good, are slow. If pressed themselves,
they cannot press their depositors. These notes
bought through note-brokers, however, are impersonal.
They can refuse to renew them. They can sell them again.
They thus buttress the rest of their assets. They can thus
lend more, rather than less, to local customers. They can
safely get along with much smaller cash reserves. Similarly
with the practice of country banks of sending a large
part of their cash to Wall Street banks to be lent on call,
for which the country banks get, say, 2% from the
Wall Street banks. Their country customers would pay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
6% or more for that money in some cases, but the banks
dare not tie up more of their assets in non-liquid local
paper. They lend more, rather than less, at home, because
they send part away. Wall Street is not "draining our
commerce of its life blood"!<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> Wall Street is rather preventing
that life blood from coagulating!</p>

<p>A second important practical conclusion relates to the
provision in the Federal Reserve Act which forbids Federal
Reserve Banks to rediscount stock exchange paper. This
provision was intended to keep funds from being diverted
from commerce to stock speculation, and doubtless met the
approval of many very good students of the subject. If
the foregoing be true, however, that provision is a mistake.
It is a mistake, first, because it will lessen, rather than increase,
the power of the Reserve Banks to provide relief
to commerce through aiding in making bank assets liquid
<i>via</i> the stock market. It will limit the liquid assets of the
Federal Reserve Banks in too great a degree to gold. It is a
mistake, in the second place, because it prevents the Reserve
Banks, particularly in New York and Boston, from
making satisfactory profits&mdash;which is one important purpose
of a bank! Even more important, however, is the
third objection: it prevents, in large degree, the Federal
Reserve Banks from being effective weapons against the
"Money Trust." How far we have a "Money Trust"
need not be here argued. The Pujo Committee, relying
in considerable degree on admissions of prominent financiers
that "concentration had gone far enough," and on the
inability of Mr. Baker to find more than one issue of securities
of over $10,000,000 within ten years, without the
co&ouml;peration or participation of one of the members of a
small group, concluded that we have a "Money Trust" in
the sense that there is "an established and well-defined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
identity and community of interests between a few leaders
of finance ... which has resulted in a vast and growing
concentration of control of money and credit in the hands of
a comparatively few men."<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> How far this conclusion is
justified is, of course, a matter that would require elaborate
discussion. There seems to be evidence that there is,
since the death of the elder Morgan, a decided loosening of
ties. One feels the need, moreover, of discounting very
considerably many of the conclusions of the Pujo Committee.
The present writer feels that the case has been
made, however, that there has been, and probably continues,
a much greater concentration of such control than
is desirable. Whether or not there is at present such a
"Money Trust," it seems pretty clear that temporary, if not
permanent, alignments, may give effective monopoly control
when the issue of very big blocks of securities is involved.
For present purposes, however, it is enough to
note that <i>if</i> there is, or should come to be, a "Money
Trust," it is a trust concerned with <i>financing industry,
through handling security issues</i>, and not a trust <i>in the granting
of ordinary commercial credit.</i><a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> If, therefore, the Federal
Reserve Banks are to compete with it, and break its
monopoly, they must do it by entering the market with
funds for the financing of corporate industry. Power to
rediscount commercial paper seems a feeble and hardly
relevant weapon against a combination concerned with
purchasing securities, and making collateral loans! No
doubt, this power is worth something. If an independent
investment banker wishes to compete with a "Money
Trust" in financing a new enterprise, he can go to his com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>mercial
banker, and offer collateral security for a loan; if
the commercial banker wishes to aid him, but is short of
lending power, he may, if he has plenty of commercial
paper available for rediscount, rediscount it with the Federal
Reserve Bank, and so get the additional funds. But
a New York bank, or trust company, with the bulk of its
assets in stock exchange investments, may well not have
enough commercial paper eligible for rediscount, and the
Federal Reserve Bank could help very much more effectively
if it could take collateral loans directly. A fourth,
and even more important objection to the restriction on
stock exchange collateral loans for Federal Reserve Banks
relates to the power of these banks to aid in a crisis. Crises
first hit the stock market. Financial panics are most
acute there. The need for immediate and drastic relief
is greatest there. If stock exchange loans lose their
liquidity, what of the rest of bank loans? Power to
lend on stock exchange collateral, in the hands of the
Federal Reserve Banks, may well prove, in crises, an
essential, if we wish to make our system definitely "panic
proof."<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>And now for a vital theoretical conclusion from this
lengthy analysis of bank loans. For the quantity theory,
and the "equation of exchange," all exchanges stand on a
par. If one exchange takes place, that lessens the money
and credit available for another exchange. The more exchanges
there are, the less money and credit there are per
exchange, and the lower prices must be, as a consequence.
Nothing could be more false. Exchanges are not on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
par.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Some classes of exchanges increase, rather than decrease
the funds available for handling others. The activity
of the speculative markets, making loans fluid,
enormously increases the lending power of the banks for all
purposes. Exchanges of securities, especially, instead of
lowering prices, make it easier for prices to rise.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
years of extraordinary stock sales have always been "bull"
years. There have been big "bear" days,<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> but never big
bear years, in the record of New York Stock Exchange
share sales. The selling and reselling of speculative goods
of securities, and of notes and bills are especially important
as making it easier for banks to expand loans. To list all
manner of items, as Professor Fisher does,<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> "real estate,
commodities, stocks, bonds, mortgages, private notes, time
bills of exchange, rented real estate, rented commodities,
hired workers," and count them all as "actual sales," all
part of the "goods"<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> which make up the "volume of
trade," is to put the theory utterly beyond the pale. Seasonal
calls on an inelastic money supply for actual cash to
move crops and pay agricultural wages may make a real
difference in the value of money; scarcity of money of the
right denominations for retail trade may give an agio to
such money,<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> but the money and credit used by specula<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>tors,
bill brokers, dealers in foreign exchange, investment
bankers, etc., increases, rather than decreases, the funds
available for ordinary industry and commerce.</p>

<p>I have made clear the distinction between the direct and
indirect financing of industry by banks. Great banks in
Continental Europe often <i>buy</i> the stocks of new corporations,
hold them permanently, put bank officers on the
boards of directors, and supervise closely the operations
of the companies. In America, while officers of commercial<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a>
banks often are members of boards of directors of the
companies which borrow heavily from the banks, the practice
is to make short-time loans to such companies (in
form, if not in fact), and to lend on their securities, rather
than to buy them. Our banks own securities in enormous
amount, but they are chiefly seasoned bonds, rather than
stocks of new or even well-proved, enterprises.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed, too, that collateral loans are
chiefly or almost wholly made to speculators, who buy securities
in the expectation of holding them only till investors
take them off their hands, and that investors buy them, not
with bank-credit derived from loans, but with money or
bank-credit which they accumulate by saving out of current
income. It is particularly true of the higher grade
securities, which savings banks and insurance companies
can buy, that this is the case. The bank-credit thus serves
for temporary, rather than for permanent financing, to the
extent that this is true. I think, however, that the extent
to which bank-credit serves for permanently financing industry
is underrated. A good many investors have learned
that the short-time money-rates are, on the long time average,
lower than the yield on long-time securities.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
have learned, too, that high-yield securities&mdash;securities
high in yield as compared with the long-time average of
money-rates&mdash;can be obtained which can safely be carried
on margins of thirty, forty and fifty points, without danger
that even such catastrophes as the slump in security prices
at the outbreak of the War will wipe the margins out. The
old distinction between investors and speculators, the
former those who buy for the yield, and the latter those
who buy for an anticipated rise in capital value, no longer
corresponds to the distinction between those who buy outright
and those who buy on a margin. The investor, buying
a 6 or 7% preferred stock, carrying it on a forty
point margin, with money from his bank or broker at
4 or 5%, is making 6 or 7% on his own forty dollars, and is
making the difference between 6 or 7% and 4 or 5% on the
sixty dollars lent him by his banker or broker. He substantially
increases his yield thereby, and his risks, if he
chooses his stocks carefully, and scatters them among a
number of issues, are not great. For the banker or broker,
such a loan is perfectly satisfactory. The margin of security
is wider than that demanded on more speculative
securities. Such a borrower will receive consideration
when more speculative loans are being called, or not renewed.
The investor of this type is, in effect, engaging in
a form of banking business. He is lending to the corporation
funds which he has borrowed from others; he has put
up his own capital for the same purpose that the bank uses
its capital&mdash;to supply a margin of safety to those who have
taken his short-term promises to pay. Like the bank, too,
he converts rights to payments at a later date into rights
to payment at an earlier date. He is one of the links in the
chain whereby the wealth of low saleability employed in
industry becomes distilled and refined till it enters the
money market. His profits come in the difference in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
yield as between more saleable and less saleable forms of
rights.</p>

<p>The extent of this practice cannot be stated, so far as any
data to which the present writer has access are concerned.
The writer has met the practice in a good many cases. One
brokerage house, with whose operations the writer has considerable
acquaintance, makes a practice of advising its
more conservative customers to do this. A good many
brokerage houses sell investment securities on the "instalment
plan," which often means, in practice, that the
initial margin put up by the investor is his only payment,
and that the security is gradually paid for by letting the
yield increase the margin. During the extremely easy
money of the present War period, occasional reference has
been made in the financial papers to the practice of buying
even the highest grade bonds on this basis&mdash;the yield of
the bonds being very substantially higher than the money-rates,
giving a comfortable profit to those who hold the
bonds on a margin.</p>

<p>That the practice is not wider spread is due primarily,
probably, to the temperamental qualities required. The
investor, proper, is commonly a very conservative person,
who has an unreasoning distrust of speculation, and to
whom the word, "margin," necessarily suggests speculation.
That buying a stock on a margin is the same sort of
thing as buying the equity in a mortgaged farm, does not
occur to him. On the other hand, the man who knows the
market well enough to be willing to deal on margins, frequently
is not content with the slow process of accumulation
which comes from annual yields, and prefers to take
larger chances in speculation on capital values. But there
is an intermediate class, who buy investment securities,
with narrow range of fluctuation in capital values, for the
sake of the yield, and who buy them on margins, margins<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
ample to enable them to sleep at night, and to neglect the
daily market reports. I think that there are indications
that this class is growing larger, and more important.
Doubtless much more important than individual "bankers"
of this sort, however, is the enormous number of houses
dealing in securities, "wholesalers" and "retailers," who
find profit on their "wares" even while on their "shelves,"
through the differential between the yield and the charge
made by commercial banks on collateral loans. A very
large percentage of collateral loans is made to institutions
of this type. As this practice becomes more important, the
result must be to widen the money market, to increase the
proportion of banking capital that goes permanently into
financing industry, and to reduce the difference in yield
between short-time paper and long-time securities&mdash;in
other words, to bring the "money-rates" closer and closer
to the long-time interest rates.</p>

<p>This would have seemed very strange and weird to Adam
Smith. It means, in effect, that the bulk of our banking
credit is, directly or indirectly, financing our industry
rather than our commerce. Adam Smith thought that a
bank could safely lend to its customers only so much as they
would otherwise keep by them in the form of money. Perhaps
this notion, as growing out of some speculations regarding
the general theory of money, should not be taken
as the statement of Smith's practical attitude on the matter,
but that practical attitude, as clearly expressed in the
paragraph<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> following, is that a bank can afford to lend
only for mercantile operations that are carried through in a
very moderate time, that the bank can afford to supply only
the minor part of the circulating capital, and no part of
the fixed capital, of a merchant, or manufacturer, no part of
his forge and smelting house, etc. Such loans lack the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
liquidity which the bank must insist upon. Only those
persons who have withdrawn from active business, and are
content with the income upon their capital, can afford to
lend for such purposes. The theory is sound, on the basis
of the facts as Smith knew them. But modern corporate
organization and modern stock markets have changed all
that. Anything that is highly saleable can come into the
money market, and the modern corporation organization
of business, coupled with organized stock exchanges and a
large and active body of speculators, has made the forge
and the smelting house as saleable as the finished product.</p>

<p>This is not to accept Schumpeter's doctrine,<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> so far as
the United States are concerned, that it is primarily the
bankers, the manufacturers of bank-credit, who make the
decisions that turn industry from old to new lines. They
do not, on the whole. In Continental Europe, particularly
Germany, they do to a much greater extent. Criticism has
been made of our American commercial bankers, as contrasted
with German bankers, that the former are parasites,
who insist on sure things, and refuse to take chances
with other business men in the development of industry.
To the present writer, our banking system seems to be
rather a more developed system than that of Germany, in
that the "division of labor" has gone further with us, and
risk-bearing and the manufacturing of bank-credit have
been more sharply differentiated. We have bankers
enough who are "risk-bearers." But they are, on the
whole, "private bankers," "investment bankers," and the
like, who do not manufacture a great deal of deposit credit,
but rather borrow heavily from the commercial banks,
which are the great manufacturers of bank-credit. Under
our system, the decisions which divert industry from old to
new lines are more democratically made, by speculators<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
and investors under the leadership of private bankers, and
sometimes without that leadership. These constitute the
important intermediary which transforms stock exchange
securities into the basis of bank-loans. The commercial
banker buys, in general, not the stocks, but the note of the
private banker, broker, speculator, or investor, with the
stocks as collateral. If investment bankers, speculators and
investors decide to support old ways of doing things, the
banks lend on the securities of the old kinds of businesses;
if investment bankers, speculators and investors turn to
new things, the commercial banks follow suit. Commercial
banks can and do discourage certain types of enterprises
by refusing loans with their securities as collateral, or by
requiring very heavy margins with such loans, but even
these may be developed, and are with us on a large scale
developed, on banking credit, advanced by the speculators
and private bankers who borrowed it from the commercial
banks with other securities as collateral. The commercial
banks of the United States may to a very considerable degree
check dynamic tendencies, but in general, they do not
lead and direct them. Bank-credit, directed by others
than commercial bankers, does, however, enormously facilitate
both the starting of new enterprises and social readjustment
to them.</p>

<p>How far can the total wealth of the country, agricultural
as well as industrial, be brought into the circle of the money
market? The full answer to the question would go far
beyond the limits of this book. If agriculture can be
brought under the control of large corporations, there is
little reason for supposing that it, too, might not come in.
There are some peculiarities of agriculture, special dangers
of drought and flood, dangers of over-production and low
prices, wide seasonal fluctuations in conditions, which
make it hard to standardize in any case. But mining and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
even the manufacturing of such things as primary steel
products have wide variations in prosperity too. So long,
however, as agriculture remains a matter of families on a
homestead&mdash;and for social and political reasons, we may
hope that this will always be the case&mdash;it is difficult to
bring it in. Bonds of agricultural associations or of agricultural
banks have had limited sale on the bourses of
Europe. The present writer, for example, found it impossible
to find in four great libraries in New York and
Boston any quotation of the bonds of the <i>Bayerische Landwirtschaftsbank</i>.
Apparently, in general, such securities
have not high saleability. While this remains true, agriculture
may expect to remain under a handicap of higher
interest rates than industry and commerce.</p>

<p>If, however, all forms of wealth could be made equally
saleable, we should find interest rates rising for those loans
and securities which now have the highest saleability.
They would lose the peculiarity which now enables them to
perform a service as bearer of options. Money-rates and
long-time rates of interest would tend to come together.
Long-time rates on formerly unsaleable loans would fall,
and rates on highly saleable loans would rise. The present
low rates in the "money market" grow out of <i>differential</i>
advantages.</p>

<p>We turn now to the third important aspect of the technique
of banking, namely, the matter of cash reserves.
First I would point out that this is merely a part of the more
general problem of liquid assets. The difference between
cash and liquid paper is a matter of degree. There is large
possibility of substitution of the one for the other, as it becomes
more profitable to use one or the other. When
money-rates are low, it may well be worth while to carry
large reserves; when money-rates are higher, the gains to be
made by substituting paper for cash in the bank's assets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
are much greater. I have pointed out the use which great
European banks, notably the Austro-Hungarian Bank,
make of foreign bills of exchange as "reserve," selling bills
when money is "easy," and the yield on bills is small, buying
bills when money is "tight," and the yield on bills is
large.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> The great Joint Stock Banks of England, the
chief sources of bank-credit in the great banking country
of the world, also make use chiefly of deposits with the
Bank of England as their "reserves." Some cash they
keep, but it is "till money," rather than reserve. They
carry, also, "secondary reserves" in highly liquid paper,
stock exchange loans and commercial bills. The differences
are differences in degree. The Bank of England does keep
a large reserve in cash (including notes of the Issue Department
and gold bullion) but it denies that it has any definite
ratio in mind,<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> and it protects its reserves, when they are
low, not by ceasing to loan, but by raising its discount-rate.
The whole thing is highly flexible.</p>

<p>This is, in general, true throughout the world,<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> where
banking is highly developed. A country which has expanding
business, based on rising values of goods and rising
capital values of anticipated incomes, which in turn grow
out of increasing business confidence, etc., and out of the
development of new enterprises which make readjustment
necessary, expands its bank-credit to meet the situation.
Expanding bank-credits in time grow so large that bankers
feel larger cash reserves to be desirable. Their reserves
may be also, in some measure, drawn upon by the growing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
retail trade and wage-payments, which call for more money
in circulation. They meet the situation by raising money-rates.
This tends to prevent the exportation of gold, and
tends to encourage the importation of gold, which finds its
way into bank reserves. Banks may even borrow directly
from banks in other countries, to get the gold they need, or
to prevent the exportation of the gold they have. The
higher money-rates, also, tend to check marginal borrowing&mdash;the
borrowing by those who see only very small
profits to be made by the use of the bank-credit they borrow.
If the rising values of goods, however, and the profits to be
made by effecting exchanges, speculative and other, are
large, the volume of bank-credit will, none the less, grow.
If the tide of rising business confidence is strong, the banks
will be disposed to accept securities and rights as collateral
which they would distrust at other times. A very big
difference indeed may appear between bank reserves in
active times and bank reserves in dull times. The banks
need less reserves in proportion to deposits in active times,
because the very activity itself increases the liquidity, the
saleability, of their paper assets, and so makes actual cash
less necessary. Even in this country, the practice of
counting deposits in other banks as reserve is well developed.
This is not only true of country banks, or banks
outside the reserve cities. It has been, in considerable
degree, the practice of the big trust companies in New York
City. It is the practice of private bankers connected with
the stock exchanges, and the practice of brokers, who are,
for many purposes, bankers, especially those who allow
their customers to check on their accounts. Such houses
may carry no cash at all. One, with whose workings the
writer is somewhat familiar, makes the rule&mdash;"We pay by
check and receive only checks." None the less, this house
allows its customers to check upon it, and checks drawn on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
it perform all the functions of checks drawn on banks which
keep a cash reserve. Of course, our new Federal Reserve
system is built, in part, on the principle of collecting reserves
in central reservoirs, and our banks will doubtless
increase the practice of counting deposits with other banks
as reserve.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> They will feel the need for less reserves, also,
with a wider rediscount market.</p>

<p><i>Within a given country</i>, I think that we may safely generalize
the doctrine that the causal relation between reserves
and deposits is exactly the reverse of that asserted
by the quantity theory, within very wide limits indeed.
That is to say, increasing reserves are a <i>result</i>, and not a
<i>cause</i>, of increasing loans and deposits. We shall further
hold that the relation between them instead of being definite,
is highly flexible. This is not to assert that reserves
may not increase without a prior increase in loans and
deposits. That has happened in the United States during
the present War. It does mean, however, that increasing
loans and deposits will pull gold into a country, and that
increasing reserves do not force increasing deposits and
loans.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> If a country's business is growing, if that business
is soundly based, so that expectations are being met, obligations
being paid out of the income which arrives, on schedule
time, to meet anticipations, there need be no effective
check to the amount of gold that will come into the country
to serve as reserves, within limits that are rarely reached.
It is miscalculation, maladjustment of costs and prices in
particular enterprises, failure of "interstitial adjustments,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
especially failure of particular crucial links in the business
chain, as the businesses engaged in producing iron and steel,
to respond to the needs of other expanding businesses,
that check movements of expansion in business, not inadequacies
of bank reserves.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> As long as only wise plans
are made, as long as they meet no mishaps, as long as the
carrying out of the new plans does not itself so change the
facts on which the calculations of business men have been
based as to cut under anticipated profits, so long may
business, within a given country, expand without danger
from inadequate reserves. Of course, if the whole world is
simultaneously expanding, the competition for gold in the
international money markets may be so severe that all
may be hampered.</p>

<p>That reserves will increase, as expanding credit, due to
increasing business or rising prices, requires increased reserves,
can hardly be disputed, I think, if we look at a
country of small size, or (what is the same thing from the
angle of economic analysis, so far as the present problem
is concerned) if we take a particular part of a country.
Seasonal movements of cash for reserves in this country
have been obviously determined by the movements of
credit, rather than the reverse. Expanding business at
crop moving seasons, requiring advances of credit by country
banks, and an unusual drain on the cash resources of
the country banks, has regularly meant that the country
banks draw cash from the New York banks. When the
need for such cash in the country banks passes, when they
can no longer employ it to advantage at home, they send it
back to New York. New York, to meet the emergency
caused by the withdrawal of cash, draws to a considerable
extent on Europe for gold. It is not as easy for New York to
get gold quickly from Europe as it is for France to get gold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
in an emergency from England. More time is required.
Inelasticity, too, in the forms of currency most needed for
small transactions, has made very real difficulties for us.
But that, within the country, the sections whose business
and credit were expanding take cash reserves from those
sections where credit is less urgently demanded, needs no
debating. This is seasonal. But the same thing is true
in the long run. As business and bank-credit have expanded,
year by year, in Oklahoma, Oklahoma's cash reserves
have grown. Bank-credit in a country cannot go on
indefinitely mounting, if bankers are making unsound
loans, if the values on which the loans rest are based on vain
imaginings, if anticipated profits are not realized. But if
a country have rich resources and intelligent entrepreneurs,
with sagacious bankers who can discriminate between
sound and unsound business, it may, within very wide
limits indeed, expand its bank-credit without check from
inadequate reserves, as its business expands, and as prices,
particularly prices of lands and securities, rise.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>

<p>If the country in question be a very large country, however,&mdash;large
in the sense that its business and volume of
bank-credit are very large, and particularly in the sense that
bankers' assets are of such character that a large volume
of reserves is desirable&mdash;restraints on the process of expansion
may come. Reserves will come in, but the resistance
in stiffer money-rates will be felt. Bankers in other countries
will compete with the bankers in the country in question
for reserves. Rising money-rates will put an end to
many marginal exchanges. They will lessen the saleability
of many rights which might otherwise be available as banking
collateral. The extension of bank-credit will feel a
drag. There is large flexibility here. But, in a long run<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
period of many years, the volume of gold in the world will
impose a maximum limit upon the possibility of expansion
of bank-credit in the world as a whole. This limit is doubtless
never reached. Within the limit, the variations in the
volume of the world's credit are primarily determined by
the other concrete factors we have been discussing. Proportionality
between the world's gold and the world's volume
of credit does not at all obtain. Under certain conditions,
much higher proportions of reserves to bank-credit
will be found in a given country than at other times, and
the same will be true in the world at large.</p>

<p>I would refer again to the discussion by J. M. Keynes,
quoted in Part II.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Reserves have absorbed enormous
quantities of gold, easily obtained as a consequence of
abundant gold production, in the past fifteen years. Proportions
of gold reserves to bank-credit have grown. In
the preceding period, when gold production went on less
rapidly than business development, percentages of reserves
were lower. Most bankers feel better with large reserves.
When they can get gold, they prefer gold to other substitutes.
When they cannot easily get gold, they use other
substitutes, of the various kinds of paper, particularly,
which have been described. Gold differs from other things,
in bankers' assets, in degree, rather than in kind. Instead,
therefore, of the law of the proportionality of reserves to
volume of bank-credit, I venture the generalization<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> that,
as gold production increases rapidly, the tendency is for
the proportion of gold reserves to volume of bank-credit to
rise; with diminished gold production, the tendency is for
the proportion of reserves to fall, assuming that the factors
other than volume of gold production which make for expansion
of business maintain themselves.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span></p>

<p>Increasing volume of gold tends to increase the volume
of trade. But there are other causes for the increase or
decrease of trade as well. These causes, working in harmony
with rapidly expanding volume of gold, lead to a very
rapid growth of trade.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Working in the face of a drag
from less rapidly growing gold supply, they strain the possibilities
of bank-credit expansion. Various substitutes
for gold in bank reserves are employed. Substitutes in the
form of other forms of credit are employed. Barter is
resorted to increasingly. Methods of employing other
things than gold in the retail trade of a country are resorted
to. "Gold-exchange" standards are devised. Countries
"wait their turns " to come on the gold standard. Co&ouml;peration,
not only within countries, but among countries, seeks
to economize the scanty stock of the precious metal. Very
large slack is thus revealed. But the expansion of business
is checked, the volume of business confidence is reduced,
the values of future incomes in enterprises is lowered, production
is checked, and prices are reduced, (a) because the
value of money rises; and (b) because the values of goods
and income-bearers is reduced. The exchange side of production
is hampered. Substitutes for gold, through increased
activities of bankers and other agents of exchange,
are costly. Greater tolls on values are taken by those who
handle the mechanism of exchange. It does make a difference
whether or not the world's gold is abundant! But the
difference is not made solely, or even mainly, in the price-level.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>The reserve function of money is essentially a <i>dynamic</i>
function. The reserve function is merely a phase of the
bearer of options function.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> It is the practice of quantity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
theorists to speak of "normal" ratios between reserves and
deposits (or reserves and demand liabilities), and to speak
of the "static" laws governing this relation. This in true
of Kemmerer, of Fisher, of A. P. Andrew, and, in general,
of contemporary quantity theorists. Kemmerer very explicitly
puts it as a matter of static theory, "If we divide
the money of the country into two parts; one, that used
directly in daily cash transactions, and the other, that kept
in banks as reserves, it may be said that, <i>under perfectly
static conditions</i> [italics mine], the proportion of the total
represented by each of these parts would be constant.
Each banker would find from experience what proportion
of reserve to liabilities it was advisable for him to maintain,
and would order his business, as far as possible, so that
his reserve would neither exceed nor fall below that most
desirable proportion."<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Kemmerer quotes the following
passage from A. P. Andrew: "In the long run, <i>as apart
from cyclic oscillations</i>, the quantity of bank-credit is governed
by the quantity of money."<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> Fisher's view we have
considered at length in Part II. It is essentially the same.
He is working with the statics of the problem of money
and credit. These different writers differ greatly in the
extent to which they would insist on the validity of their
static tendency in real life. Professor Fisher, as we have
seen, is exceedingly uncompromising, holding tenaciously
to his principle as subject only to slight modification
during transition periods. Professor Kemmerer, in the
chapter from which the quotation just given is taken, gives
an important realistic analysis of dynamic conditions and
makes liberal concessions to the view that the ratio is no
constant in real life.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> Professor Taussig, whose view was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
summarized at length in chapter IX, finds, in real life, so
many exceptions to the doctrine of proportionality of reserves
and deposits that he virtually abandons that doctrine.
What I wish to insist on here, however, is that there
are no static laws <i>possible</i> in this connection. The reserve
function is a dynamic function. The theory of reserves
must rest in an analysis of friction, of transitions, of dynamic
uncertainty and dynamic change. It is a part of the
general theory of liquidity of bank assets, of saleability
of rights, and the like. If one can find a "normal" amount
of dynamic change, a "normal" amount of uncertainty, a
norm for the coming of technical inventions, a normal
prospect of war, a normal rate of gold production, a normal
rate of growth for population, a normal amount of Jew-baiting
in Russia, with a norm for migration, and if one can
hold these norms, and a multitude of similar norms, in
fixed relation to one another, one might have justification
for speaking of a "normal ratio" of bank reserves to bank
demand liabilities!</p>

<p>Apart from dynamic changes, from frictional elements
which create uncertainties, in general, apart from uncertainty
and irregularity and lack of "normality," there would
be no occasion for bank reserves at all! To the extent that
static conditions are realized, bank cash reserves may be,
and <i>are</i>, dispensed with. It is well known that England
gets along with surprisingly little gold. The total stock
in the country has been smaller than the gold reserve of the
Banque de France, and much of the gold in England was
in use among the people, since small paper money (before
the War) was not in use in England. The gold reserve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>of the Bank of England has been usually only a fraction
of that of the Banque de France. Some years since, the
distribution of gold as between England and the United
States, was, roughly, England six hundred million dollars,
the United States, one billion, six hundred million. A
larger proportion of gold was in reserves in the United
States than in England. Yet England was doing the banking
business of the world, while we had trouble in doing our
own! The Bank of England carries virtually the only reserve
in the country. The Joint Stock Banks, with demand
liabilities vastly in excess of the demand liabilities of the
Bank of England, carry only "till money" in cash or Bank
of England notes, and for the rest, carry as their "reserve"
their deposit credits with the Bank. A great deal of criticism,
from Bagehot down (to go no further back) has been
directed at the "inadequacy" of English banking reserves,
and many dire predictions have been made as to the dangers
that impended unless the reserves were increased. We
shall probably hear less of this after the War! The Bank
of England still stands! It has never failed to pay out
gold over its counters, even though it has, with the aid of
the government, doubtless restricted and controlled foreign
shipments of gold. But it has met the unprecedented
emergency better than any other bank in Europe, and to-day
(Sept. 1916) is in exceedingly good shape. Sterling
exchange at New York seems "pegged" at the "lower gold
point," and apprehensions regarding the stability of the
English financial system seem definitely allayed. It is
aside from our present purpose to discuss war time conditions.
I am rather interested in analyzing the features of
the English money market which have made it possible, in
the period preceding the War, for English bankers to get on
with so little gold. As will appear, it is because English business
and financial affairs have been more nearly "static,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
have come nearer to realizing the assumptions of static
economic theory, than is true of any other country on earth.</p>

<p>The very fact, for one thing, that England is the great
<i>international</i> banker has meant a scattering of risks. Acute
panics do not come in all countries on the same date.
Bad business in one country may be offset by good
business in another; drains of gold to one country may be
met with gold flowing in from others. The same considerations
which tend to stabilize the railroad business, as compared
with, say, cotton-growing, apply to the international
banker as compared with the banks of a single country or
section. But further, the London market has developed
co&ouml;perating agencies for smoothing out friction and eliminating
uncertainties to a degree unknown anywhere else.
An anonymous writer in <i>The Americas</i> for April, 1916,<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> has
given an exceedingly interesting account of this organization
of the London market,&mdash;the product of the development
of generations. Let us enumerate some of the points:
There is nowhere in the world so much expert judgment in
the grading and evaluating of hundreds of commodities
from all parts of the world. There is, coupled with this, a
worldwide reputation for the experts of absolute integrity,
so that producers in remote countries regularly ship ("consign")
to London cargoes without definite arrangements,
knowing that there are in London organized facilities by
which the commodities are warehoused, expertly and fairly
judged, and either sold at once or else made the basis of a
collateral loan against which they can draw immediately.
The institutions which make this possible are (a) the system
of warehousing, with its certificates or warrants which give
absolute title to the goods, and which are easily negotiable;
(b) the organized arrangements in connection with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
warehouses by which commodities are received and either
graded as they are, or separated and mixed with others to
form standard blends readily marketable&mdash;this with rigid
integrity and expertness which the whole world trusts;
(c) a speculative community which has unlimited banking
credit, ready to buy at a concession in price virtually any
commodity&mdash;honey in the comb, sealing wax, pianos, farm
machinery, what not; (d) the organized markets or periodical
auctions which speculation and final purchase together
support; (e) the banks, which, relying on the standardization
of the commodities and the readiness of the speculative
community, can without hesitation lend the money on
which the distant shipper is relying to conduct his business.</p>

<p>What comes to London is fluid. Everything comes to
London! The multiplicity of items dealt in gives stability
to that business which deals with all&mdash;the banking business.
The London Stock Exchange is no provincial affair, easily
demoralized by an adverse rate decision! Securities of
every country on earth are listed there, and speculated in.
It must be a world catastrophe which really demoralizes
the London stock market!</p>

<p>It will doubtless seem strange to many to say that New
York cannot displace London as the centre of world finance,
that the dollar cannot displace the pound sterling in financing
international trade, because New Yorkers do not speculate
enough! They do speculate enormously, but not in
many things. A restricted list of stock exchange securities&mdash;almost
wholly American; cotton&mdash;in which New
York is the world centre; coffee, in which New York has
the largest volume of speculative futures, though yielding
precedence, ordinarily, to Havre, Hamburg and Santos<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
spot transactions. There is extensive sugar speculation at
the New York Coffee Exchange, which has, indeed, recently
changed its name to indicate the fact. There is a
produce exchange in New York, but it is a very small
affair as compared with the Chicago Board of Trade, and
its operations and scope are infinitesimal when compared
with the produce speculation in London. Of course, there
is a vast deal of <i>unorganized</i> speculation in many things in
New York, as in business everywhere, particularly in America.
But, while the pecuniary magnitudes of organized
speculation in New York are very great, the range of items
dealt in is restricted. New York banks cannot possibly
get such a variety of collateral, based on standardized and
readily marketable goods and securities, as can London.
New York, consequently, cannot finance international
trade, save as an auxiliary to London&mdash;and New York
banks must have vastly more gold in their vaults than
London bankers need! As goods and securities become
<i>more</i> marketable, gold&mdash;whose services are needed because
of its <i>superior</i> marketability&mdash;becomes <i>less</i> necessary.</p>

<p>The whole story of London's organization would be a
long one. London financial institutions have a degree of
expertness, growing out of specialization, in large part,
which makes all manner of paper fluid in the London
money market which would lack fluidity in New York.
The Acceptance Houses are a sort of international Bradstreet
and Dun. They know intimately the standing and
business of houses all over the world. They do not give
out their information, but they do put their stamp on the
paper of business houses, thus standardizing it, lending, not
money, but "pure credit," while the other banks, relieved
of the necessity of investigating the paper, can buy it as
a miller might buy No. 1 wheat. There is the extraordinary
extension of insurance, so that virtually any kind of risk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
may be shifted to those well able to bear it. All this makes
for liquidity, for "static" conditions in the money market,
and dispenses with the need for gold.</p>

<p>As we approach static conditions, we need less and less
gold reserve behind bank demand liabilities. <i>The static
law of bank reserves is that none are needed!</i> I think we have
here the real reason why writers who have sought to give
us the law for a "normal" ratio have given us such vague
phrases as "shown by experience to be necessary," and the
like. When irregularity of income and outgo in a bank's
business, non-liquid assets, business cycles, uncertainties,
legislative changes affecting business, crop failures, changes
in demand, new inventions, wars, are abstracted from, no
reason can be given why a banker should keep any reserve
at all! But these things are dynamic things. And it is
characteristic of irregularities that they are irregular. To
get a "normal" ratio out of them is not easy.</p>

<p>On the static assumptions, an "ideal credit economy" is
perfectly possible. If everything that needs to be marketed
is perfectly marketable, if the stream of business flows
regularly and without friction in the same channels, if all
contingencies are foreseen and dated in advance, a bank
needs no cash reserve. All payments can be made by bank-credit.
Banks bookkeeping becomes merely a refinement of
barter, with <i>money</i> remaining as a measure of values, a unit
for reckoning, but not being used as a medium of exchange,
or as a bearer of options, or in reserves. The measure of
values function is the great static function of money.</p>

<p>To the extent that static assumptions are not realized,
we need money in bank reserves. This extent is a thing
that varies from time to time, and from place to place. It
is not the same for a given place from time to time, nor is
it the same at all places at a given time. It is not the same
for the whole world from time to time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span></p>

<p>Since friction, preventing the free marketing of goods and
securities and services, exists, since there are dynamic
changes which require readjustments through exchanges,
we need the work of the banker and he needs cash. But
there are other things than money which make for the
"statification" of the market. The speculator does it.
And the other agencies of the sort represented in the London
market do it. They are substitutes for gold. Gold
has no monopoly. The services performed by gold can be
performed in many other ways, and by many other agencies.
There is enormous flexibility in the matter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV</h3>

<h3>THE RECONCILIATION OF STATICS AND DYNAMICS</h3>


<p>In the foregoing discussion of the value of money it has
appeared that the value of money is not an isolated problem!
Not only have we found it necessary to consider it as
part of the general theory of value, but it has been advisable
to bring it into relation with a large number of the special
theorems of economics, including the law of supply and demand,
cost of production, the capitalization theory, the
doctrine of appreciation and interest, the theory of international
gold movements, Gresham's Law, the theory of
elastic bank-credit, and the general theory of prosperity.
The book has thus become a book on general economic
theory, viewed from the standpoint of the theory of money.
It has been as contributing to the problem of the value of
money that these other doctrines have been discussed, but
I trust that they, too, have gained something of clarification
from being considered in this relation, and that the
emphasis on the r&ocirc;le of money in general economic theory
has helped in bringing the various elements in our current
theory into a closer-knit interdependence.</p>

<p>The present chapter seeks to carry the conclusions so far
reached toward a further unification of economic doctrine,
by finding for certain contrasts, like that between statics
and dynamics, a higher synthesis, so that it may be possible
for students of dynamics and students of statics to speak
a common language, to use common measures, to find that
their phenomena are not, after all, of essentially different
nature, and to come to agreement as to the relative im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[Pg 548]</a></span>portance
of "static" and "dynamic" tendencies. It will
appear that the theory of money and exchange plays an
important r&ocirc;le in effecting that higher synthesis, and is
itself clarified by it.</p>

<p>The "theory of goods vs. the theory of prosperity,"
"statics vs. dynamics," "normal vs. transitional tendencies,"
"long run vs. short run" laws, "market vs. normal
price," "abstract theory vs. concrete description," "historical
or evolutionary study vs. cross-section analysis,"
"temporal vs. logical priority," "causation as a temporal
sequence vs. causation as timeless logical relationships"&mdash;these,
and similar contrasts have appeared frequently in
the history of social thought, and have been especially refined
and elaborated in the history of economics. We
have even compounding of the notions into more complicated
distinctions, as by Seligman,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> in his two statements
of the law of costs: in the short run, normal price tends to be
the maximum cost of production; in the long run, normal
price tends to be minimum cost of production. Seligman
has illustrated his notion by an adaptation of the familiar
figure of the sea-level and the waves: for short-run purposes,
we may contrast the surface waves, the market prices, with
the sea-level, the normal price; for longer run purposes we
may see the level of the sea itself changing, under the influence
of the tide, and may have a dynamic normal, which
is still to be distinguished from the fluctuations due to the
play of winds on the surface.</p>

<p>We have further an increasing recognition of the up and
down play of forces accelerating and retarding the processes
of industry and trade. For earlier writers, panics and
crises were anomalies; since Mill's <i>Principles of Economics</i>,
to go back no further, we have had increasing recognition
of such occurrences as more or less periodic and inevitable,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[Pg 549]</a></span>
bound up in the very nature of economic life itself, and of
late there has been a fairly general acceptance of the notion
of the business cycle, of an alternating rhythm of prosperity
and depression. The explanation of this alternation has
been attempted by numerous theories, one of which, that
of Joseph Schumpeter,<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> rests the whole case definitely in
the distinction between static and dynamic tendencies, and
in the conflict between the opposing sets of forces which
statics and dynamics undertake to describe.</p>

<p>We are told by the orthodox economist that war is
wasteful, destroying laborers and goods, and lessening the
wealth and productive power of society. We are told that
it diverts labor from productive employments, that it turns
huge masses of capital and labor to the production of goods
which men cannot enjoy, that it burdens the people with
taxes, etc. Static theory can see nothing but evil in war,
from the standpoint of minimizing human sacrifices, and
maximizing human enjoyments. None the less we see
many war periods&mdash;notably that of our Spanish-American
War, and the present World War, so far as the United
States are concerned&mdash;periods of marked prosperity, growing
out of the new expenditures which war itself involves.
Mules and other farm products rose in price with the
Spanish-American War, as the Federal Government bought
them for the army; various factories concerned particularly
with war munitions increased their activity, the gains of
factory owners and farmers led them to increase their
purchases, wages rose, and rose in part because part of the
labor force was in the army. The Civil War did spell
demoralization and economic ruin for the South, but for
the North it gave a great dynamic impetus to trade, transportation
and industry&mdash;an impetus, strangely enough,
that was so great that the new industries and enterprises<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[Pg 550]</a></span>
which had grown up were able to absorb with little shock
the million men set free from the Northern armies when the
great struggle was over.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>For static theory, scarcity is an evil. A general overproduction
is impossible. For the practical business man,
confronted with the momentous problem of marketing his
output, overproduction is a vital reality, and there are few
times indeed when much more could not be produced if
only a satisfactory market could be found for it. Static
theory would see the whole explanation of this in maladjustment,
too much of some things being produced, too
little of others. This simple statement does explain much
of the phenomenon, but it is far from telling the whole
story, and even if it were a complete explanation, it would
by no means dispose of the reality of overproduction as a
constant menace, even when not a dire reality, facing almost
every business man. Static theory at best tells what a
completed adjustment would be; it does not touch the
problem of how adjustment is brought about, and maladjustment
overcome. Yet just that problem is the vital
concern of the business man.</p>

<p>For static theory, high or low prices are matters of no
concern. And abundance or scarcity of money and credit
make no real difference in the economic process. Abundant
money and credit exhaust themselves in raising prices, and
the rest of economic life goes on unchanged. This doctrine
of the quantity theory is, as I have undertaken to show in
Part II, bad even as a matter of static theory. But it is
only as a matter of static theory that it is even thinkable.</p>

<p>The economic theory of the 19th Century, following the
lead of Adam Smith and Ricardo, has been accustomed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[Pg 551]</a></span>
dismiss as utter folly the notions of the Mercantilists as to
the balance of trade, and the importance of an inflow of
gold, and has conclusively proved that protective tariffs
tend to divert the labor, capital and land of a country from
those lines of production they are best adapted to to lines
for which they are less well suited. Critics have pointed
out, as in the "infant industries" argument, that we cannot
treat the labor capacity and technical knowledge of a
country as constants, that the temporary encouragement
of one line of industry by a tariff may so modify the data
of the situation that the country may in time become better
adapted to the protected industry than to other lines. And
I think that we may well go further, and make substantial
concessions to the doctrines of the Mercantilists as they
themselves stated them, seeing in a favorable balance of
trade, and in expanding exports and diminishing imports
sources of impetus which are not subsequently neutralized
by the static process of equilibration. I do not conclude
from this that protective tariffs are commendable, any
more than I conclude that war is commendable. Both
may give dynamic impetus, and lead to economic development.
Both may lead to political corruption, to iniquities
in the distribution of wealth, to waste and suffering of
various kinds, in which honest and patriotic men suffer,
and cunning and unworthy men gain. The point here is
simply that static theory does not tell the whole story regarding
either tariffs or wars. It may well be true&mdash;I
think it is true&mdash;that static theory offers the more important
principles for judging the results of wars and tariffs.<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[Pg 552]</a></span>
is the central problem which I have set myself at the outset
of this discussion to find a way to bring static and dynamic
considerations <i>under a common measure</i>, to reduce them to
homogeneity so that comparisons may be instituted, and
so that the student of statics and the student of dynamics
need not talk merely at cross-purposes. But we do not
achieve this result by ignoring considerations in either
sphere.</p>

<p>Bastiat, with a fine show of logic, has sought to rule out
of court the doctrines that extravagance and tariffs, etc.,
are sources of prosperity by his emphasis on the "Unseen,"
as opposed to the "Seen." The prosperity growing out of
the extravagant expenditures of one brother is open to all
eyes. The consequences of the savings of the frugal brother
men do not see so easily, and do not attribute to his frugality.
Doubtless Bastiat is right in his main theses. But
one point needs emphasis: that which is "Seen" stirs the
imagination of men. And imagination energizes human
activity. The motivation of economic life is a psychological
matter.</p>

<p>And so at a host of points the contrast may be drawn, in
one or another form. The pure, abstract, static theory
gives one conclusion; the other approach suggests one
different.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<p>How is it possible to give proper weight to considerations
drawn from such divergent spheres of thought? Indeed, how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">[Pg 553]</a></span>
shall we weigh the dynamic considerations at all? Static
theory presents itself in quasi-mathematical form. At
times, it parades itself in equations, and it readily enough,
without arousing a feeling of incongruity, expresses itself
in mathematical curves, with ordinates and absciss&aelig;.
One static tendency finds itself in marginal equilibrium
with another, and the margin is expressed in quantitative
units, commonly sums of money. Static doctrine does, indeed,
lay claim to precision and exactness, and static tendencies
may be weighed against one another. But how
shall one undertake to give quantitative measure to such
a thing as the educational influence of a tariff on silk manufacture?
How measure the dynamic impetus of a new
chain of banks on the industry and trade of the region
affected? How gauge the importance of a new advertising
scheme, or a new invention? Dynamic considerations
are commonly presented in vaguer, looser form than
static theories. Usually we have merely a statement of a
qualitative tendency, without effort to make the importance
of the tendency quantitative. Indeed, I think it safe to
say that one chief difference between statics and dynamics
is that those tendencies which can be most easily formulated
have been recognized by statics, while those which are
less understood, and less precisely formulated, are left to
dynamics! A big part of the difference is methodological,
rather than inherent in the nature of the phenomena themselves.</p>

<p>I think that it needs little argument to show that all the
contrasts listed at the beginning of this chapter do not run
on all fours. Compare, let us say, the contrast between
"statics and dynamics" with that between "historical and
cross-section" study. Concrete, realistic history is not
dynamic theory. A realistic description of society viewed
at a given short period of time is not static theory. Both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[Pg 554]</a></span>
statics and dynamics are <i>abstract</i>. <i>Laws</i> are not the same
thing as description and narration. The assertions of
both statics and dynamics are commonly made on the
assumption, "<i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>." A new bank will stimulate
business in a western town if bank-robberies do not come
into fashion! A tariff on wool will tend to educate the
farmers in sheep-raising if the habit of relying on governmental
assistance does not develop, and make them more,
rather than less, inert,&mdash;or sharpen their political rather
than their economic acumen. Concrete history need not
always verify dynamic laws!<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> It is, above all, important
to insist that the distinction between statics and dynamics
is not the same as the distinction between theory and
description, or between the abstract and the concrete.
Evolutionary study may result either in concrete history,
or generalized laws; cross-section study may be either concrete
description or abstract formul&aelig; concerning forces
in equilibrium. And there may be varying degrees of
abstractness in both cases.</p>

<p>The contrast between long-run and short-run tendencies
is not necessarily the same as that between statics and
dynamics. This former distinction does recognize one
factor which is sometimes classed as "dynamic," namely,
"friction."&mdash;"Friction," by the way, is a blanket term
which covers a multitude of sins of imperfect analysis and
lazy thinking! It is far from a simple, unitary thing.
Sometimes it seems to mean the action of the whole social
order, other than the economic values!&mdash;But dynamic, as
used by the two writers who have used the term most precisely,
J. B. Clark<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> and J. Schumpeter,<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> is reserved for
those factors in economic life which make for constructive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[Pg 555]</a></span>
<i>change</i>. Neither writer would call mere habit and inertia,
which make readjustments slow, or the necessities of physical
nature, which retard readjustment, by the name,
"dynamic." It may be noted, in passing, that both writers
limit the term quite strictly to changes <i>in</i> economic life
growing <i>out of</i><a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> economic causes. Schumpeter narrows the
dynamic factors to one, namely, <i>enterprise</i>, while Clark
gives five general classes of dynamic factors, all of which
are primarily economic in character. Neither extends his
study to cover forces which are not primarily economic in
character, but which none the less lead to economic changes.</p>

<p>Again, the "theory of prosperity" is not identical with
"economic dynamics," though the two in large measure
overlap. For one thing, while some writers, as Schumpeter,
find the business cycle to be a necessary consequence of
dynamic changes, and would maintain that no business
cycle, no up and down of tempo in production, no panics
or crises, are necessary if changed methods of industry, etc.,
did not come in, not all writers would so explain the business
cycle. Some writers would find the explanation in the
inherent instability of a money and credit economy, some
in the inherent weakness of a capitalistic system, quite
apart from necessary dynamic change. Irving Fisher
makes no use of changed methods of production in his explanation
of business cycles, though he does mention invention
as one possible cause of a disturbance in normal
equilibrium.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> But further, dynamics is largely concerned
with problems, like invention, changes in the economic
habits of a people, methods of organizing industry, etc.,
which, while they may well bear on the problems of prosperity
and depression, yet have interest for their own sake,
and would be studied if there were no business cycles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[Pg 556]</a></span>
Further, the notion of statics, the other term in the static-dynamic
contrast, is not identical with the "theory of
wealth," or "theory of goods," or "theory of the wealth of
nations" which such a writer as Veblen<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a> would put in
contrast with his "theory of prosperity." There is a
normative, or practical, and polemical coloring in the body
of doctrine growing out of Adam Smith, which Veblen
would term, the "theory of the wealth of nations," which
is lacking in the more colorless "statics" of to-day.</p>

<p>I do not find any of the contrasts thus far discussed quite
satisfactory. I have been using the terms, statics and
dynamics, as general terms to cover all these contrasts.
I shall try to formulate a general contrast which includes
most of the ideas passed in review, from a somewhat different
angle, and then try to show that the contrast, while
useful, is not absolute, and that it is possible to measure
considerations drawn from one viewpoint in terms of
considerations drawn from the other.</p>

<p>Let us take as our starting point the notion of a cross-section
picture of society. I have set forth this notion in
ch. 13 of my <i>Social Value</i>, and have elaborated it in the
discussion of von Mises' theory in the chapter on "Marginal
Utility" in this book. A cross-section picture may
be made more or less concrete and descriptive, or abstract
and analytical. If one looks at the picture of society in
cross-section as given by Giddings in his <i>Principles of Sociology</i>
(Bk. II, chapters on "The Social Population," "The
Social Mind," "The Social Composition," and "The Social
Constitution"), one finds a picture in which organization
and system are made clear, but in which vivid description
of concrete social facts is the primary concern. The account
given is largely qualitative rather than quantitative.
It is a picture of flesh and blood, as well as an account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[Pg 557]</a></span>
functioning. It is, perhaps, not easy to realize that Giddings
is doing the same general sort of thing that the pure
economic theorist is doing, with his picture of a static
equilibrium of economic values. But what economic
theory is concerned with is, after all, to be found in Giddings'
scheme. The pure theorist takes for granted the
physiographic environment, whose influence Giddings
takes into account. The theorist abstracts from biological
and racial factors. He assumes a social population, a
social order, a political system. He has not taken into his
purview the social mind as a whole, in his static theory.
Rather, he has been concerned with only one part of the
social mind, namely, the economic values. Economic
values, and the objects of economic value, have been the
data of the static theorist. Given scales of economic
value, such that for one quantity of goods of a given kind,
a given value per unit will obtain, given all of these value-scales,
and given the quantities of goods and services whose
values are in question, and static theory will furnish an
equilibrium picture, in which the price relations of different
kinds of goods are made clear, and their values are measured.
The value-scales, and the absolute magnitudes of
value at different points on the scale, are assumed, are
data. Further, in order that the notions may be made
mathematically precise, a unit of value is needed, and this
is commonly the value of the money-unit, which is assumed
to be constant. The picture then becomes systematic.
There is a system of values, expressed in prices, which is
stable, so long as the data do not change. It is mechanically
conceived, and illustrated by various mechanical symbols,
as balls in a bowl, or connecting reservoirs, or, best of
all, by intersecting curves. It is an abstraction from the
living, pulsing, organic whole of the social mind&mdash;the inter-mental
life of men in society. It squeezes much of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[Pg 558]</a></span>
life out of the phenomena it describes. It makes them
exact, only by making them mechanical. It thus becomes
exact by becoming, in considerable degree, superficial and
abstract.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> This is not to condemn static theory. Static
theory has proved its usefulness by solving too many problems
for such a statement of its limitations to involve a
condemnation. But the statement of its limitations will
aid us in seeing its relation to that vaguer body of doctrine
which we call dynamics, or the theory of prosperity, etc.</p>

<p>Now this means that static theory is not <i>value</i> theory.
It assumes a theory of value. It assumes the value-scales
as data. It assumes the value of money as a datum.
Static theories of supply and demand, cost of production,
capitalization, etc., assume the value of money, as has
been shown in Part I, and static theory, resting in the notion
of accomplished transition, normal equilibrium, abstracting
from the difficulties of readjustment, abstracting from
friction, etc., misses the whole point as to the functions of
money, as shown in Part II. Static theory proceeds by
assuming a change in one of the elements of its situation,
say one of the value-scales, and then tells what the new
equilibrium will be after readjustment takes place, assuming
that other value-scales remain constant, and that quantities
of the objects of value do not change. Or, it assumes a
change in the quantity of one of the objects of value, and
then predicts the new equilibrium. The new equilibrium
will often involve changed values and prices all around, and
will often involve altered quantities of other objects of value.
But the initial change comes from an alteration <i>from outside</i>
the system in one or more of the data of the system.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[Pg 559]</a></span>Now dynamics, theory of prosperity, etc., are concerned
with the causes of changes in the data with which statics
works, in large measure. Among the problems with which
statics has not adequately dealt, and in large measure cannot
deal, are (1) the nature of value itself, and the laws
governing changes in the value-scales; (2) the problems of
readjustment, including the problems of money, credit and
exchange; (3) the psychology of invention, of enterprise,
and the like. (4) The reactions of economic values and
economic organization on the non-economic phases of
social life. (5) The reaction of the non-economic factors,
as law, morals, art, religion, etc., on economic life. (6) The
problem of prosperity and depression. I say that statics
has not dealt adequately with these problems. Statics
in its present narrow form cannot deal with them. But
in considerable degree, I am convinced, statics can be made
to deal more adequately with them, if its scope be broadened,
and its limitations be made less rigid. Schematically,
at least, the central ideas of statics can be applied to a
large part of these problems. I may add that my list of
six classes of problems with which statics has not adequately
dealt is not meant as a system of categories. The
list is incomplete, and the classes are not mutually exclusive.
Rather, they overlap in large measure. In a
large way, it might be said that statics is concerned with
the laws of the equilibration of values, and that dynamics,
theory of prosperity, etc., are concerned with the nature and
causes of variations in the values themselves. The contrast
may be put, in general, as the contrast between the
<i>theory of value</i>, and the <i>theory of price</i>, statics being price-theory,
and dynamics being value-theory. But this is a
thesis which calls for much elaboration and qualification
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[Pg 560]</a></span>before its significance is made clear, to say nothing of its
justification being established.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>We may approach the problem of bringing the two terms
of the contrast together from either of two angles: (1) we
may show that dynamic factors tend, in large degree, to
submit themselves to measurement in terms of money-prices,
which obey the laws of static marginal equilibrium.
(2) We may show that all static prices presuppose values
whose explanation is in terms of the same phenomena with
which dynamics, the theory of prosperity, etc., have busied
themselves, namely, considerations drawn from the study
of social psychology, including the psychology of suggestion,
imitation, mob-mind, the functional organization of
minds into a social mind, social beliefs, social values of
other than economic nature, and social institutions. (1) The
evidence on the first point is already in considerable measure
worked out, particularly by Veblen, in his <i>Theory of
Business Enterprise</i>, and in his other writings on the nature
of capital, etc. Something more in this direction I have
done in my <i>Social Value</i>, and other writers have elaborated
the notion. (2) The case for the second contention
has been made in detail in my <i>Social Value</i>, and in what
follows I shall rely chiefly on the discussion presented there,
and in the chapter on "Value" in this book.</p>

<p>I take up first the thesis that dynamic factors may come
under the static measure. Veblen has made much of the
contention that modern "capital" is not, as Smith thought,
and as orthodox economists in general have contended, a
matter of physical accumulations of goods. The volume of
business capital is a pecuniary concept, and may wax and
wane with little variation in the physical stocks. "Under
modern conditions the magnitude of the business capital
and its mutations from day to day are in great measure a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">[Pg 561]</a></span>
question of folk psychology rather than of material fact."
(<i>Theory of Business Enterprise</i>, p. 149.) And in large
measure Veblen's work is given to showing how factors of
legal and social psychological nature get a money-measure.
The actual capital of a business enterprise does not rest
chiefly on the physical equipment, stocks of raw materials,
etc., etc., which it possesses. To be added is "good will,"
and this includes (p. 139) established customary business
relations, reputation for fair dealing, franchises, privileges,
trade-marks, brands, patent rights, copyrights, exclusive
use of processes guarded by law or secrecy, exclusive control
of particular sources of materials, etc. Veblen contrasts
things of this nature sharply with the concrete equipment,
saying that the former are serviceable only to the owners,
while the latter are serviceable to the community at large
as well. The physical, tangible, and ethically commendable
character of the physical equipment is everywhere stressed,
while the pathological, anomolous, and sinister character of
the less tangible and more recent "capital items" is always
set before us&mdash;all the more effectively because Veblen maintains
a satirical attitude of moral indifference, and presents
the case with Olympian aloofness. I am not here concerned
with the social welfare aspect of the matter, though I shall
later speak of that. My present purpose is to make clear
two points in Veblen's doctrine: (1) that he does bring these
intangible things, which are the variables involved in his
theory of prosperity, under the price measure; and (2) that
he considers these prices as anomalies from the standpoint
of the general laws governing the values and prices of concrete
goods. To this last point I shall later take sharp
exception. For the present, I wish to develop further the
extent to which such factors may be brought under the
general static measure.</p>

<p>The feature of static theory which Veblen chiefly em<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[Pg 562]</a></span>ploys
in giving a money-measure to his "intangible capital"
is the capitalization theory.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> The capital magnitude of the
items of good will previously mentioned is a capitalization
of the <i>income</i> which they are expected to bring in. And it
may be said that a large part of Veblen's doctrine of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[Pg 563]</a></span>
causes of the ups and downs of business rests on the complaint
that this capitalization process is not rationally
carried through&mdash;that incomes are overestimated, and that
business men are tenacious of capital magnitudes once built
up, and refuse to mark them down properly when the facts
in the situation have changed. His theory of prosperity
thus rests on non-rational enthusiasm on the one hand, and
a certain kind of "friction" on the other hand, and apparently
the difficulties in the situation as he sees it would
largely disappear if these two elements could be rationalized,
and the static theory work more perfectly. The elements
involved in the capitalization theory, as shown in
the chapter on that topic, are three: the anticipated income,
the prevailing rate of discount, and the capital value, the
last named being the child of the first two. The capital
magnitude is a shadow, where the income is the substance.
Veblen seems to find the trouble arising in that the capital
magnitude takes on a substantial character, and refuses
to play the passive r&ocirc;le of shadow. It is interesting, in
passing, to compare this theory of Veblen's with the theory
of crises developed by Irving Fisher, from the standpoint
of a body of doctrine which is purely static, and which
Veblen has criticised as "taxonomic" in a high degree.
For Fisher<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> the trouble arises from friction in connection
with another element in the capitalization problem, namely,
the interest rate. Business men think that "a dollar's a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[Pg 564]</a></span>
dollar," and refuse to let the interest rate be marked up in
accordance with the doctrine of "appreciation and interest."
This, likewise, leads to overcapitalization, leaves
the passive shadow too big. I must confess that it seems
to me that one theory is about as "taxonomic" as the
other&mdash;that both rest on pointing out divergences from a
static, "taxonomic" norm. In general, Veblen's work in
this field consists in assimilating the "intangible" capital
to the class of land, and other long time concrete income-bearers,
but that is after all classification, systematization,
"taxonomy." In saying all this, I am as far as possible
from questioning the value of Veblen's work. Rather I
rate it as of extreme significance. "Taxonomy" does not
appear to me so dreadful a word as it does to Veblen. I
should rather say that some taxonomy is good and some is
bad, depending on whether or not it leads to fruitful generalizations,
and deeper insights.</p>

<p>It is, as I have said, chiefly the capitalization theory
which Veblen applies to these newly important intangible
"capital-items." The phenomena of the stock-market,
where such things are most actively bought and sold, and
where they appear as differential portions of the capital
values of securities, doubtless first called attention to them&mdash;though
the item of "good will" as a business asset, for
which a money-price is paid when businesses change hands,
is doubtless older and wider than modern corporation
finance. The capitalization theory applies to them most
readily and obviously, as compared with other elements in
the static theory of prices.</p>

<p>But as we become better used to the large r&ocirc;le which
these phenomena play,&mdash;not that the phenomena are new,
but that their present importance is new, and hence our
serious study of them is new&mdash;we are increasingly able to
see that other elements of static theory also apply. <i>Static</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[Pg 565]</a></span>
<i>theory applies increasingly as understanding increases!</i> The
vaguely discerned, the novel, the imperfectly analyzed,
can be stated only in qualitative terms. As things are
better understood, the mind seeks system, taxonomy,
quantitative measurement. Business men to-day are well
accustomed to applying <i>cost</i> concepts to many of these intangible
magnitudes. Advertising, for example, is being
worked out with increasing exactness, and business men are
increasingly applying accounting processes to the determination
of the question of <i>how much</i> advertising "pays."
Well-known brands are capital items. Well-known brands
have cost money! Business men contemplating the marketing
problem may well balance the cost of creating a
new brand against the cost of buying an old one, and may
balance the cost of creating a new brand against the profit
to be made from allowing an old one to deteriorate, through
cheapening its process of manufacture. Trade-connections
are capital items. They are also items which have
been created by patient thought and labor and expense.
Franchises, since the days when the public awoke to their
value, have cost money to the corporations that possess
them, and figure in corporate bookkeeping often. Even
in the old days, they often had a cost, which commonly
stayed <i>out</i> of the corporations' books, at least in that form,&mdash;bribes,
entertainments to legislators and members of
councils, and so on. In Part II of this book,<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> I have discussed
"selling costs" as contrasted with costs of production
in the narrow sense, and have pointed out how high a
proportion of total costs these selling costs are. I have
also indicated how many of these costs tend to be "capitalized."
These selling costs are static measures of the
elements of "friction" which interfere with the smooth
working of static laws! An extension of statics, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[Pg 566]</a></span>
can in considerable degree take account of them. It is, of
course, far from true that cost doctrine will explain all of
these intangible capital magnitudes. But this is likewise
true of the prices of many tangible items. Cost doctrine
does not hold universal sway even in the confines of the
strictest static theory.</p>

<p>I have said that dynamic factors tend to come under the
rules of static taxonomy to the extent that they become
more accurately understood. The understanding here referred
to is not merely on the part of the scientific theorist!
The subject-matter of economic science is itself psychological.
It includes the psychology of the business man, as
well as the psychology of purchasers and laborers, and the
general field of social-mental life that bears on economic
processes. It includes the theories of the business men, as
well as their aspirations and "motives." It includes their
methods of computation, and the accuracy or inaccuracy
of their prognostications. It has been pointed out recently
that at the current price of copper (22c. per pound in Jan.
1916) the prices of copper stocks are very much lower than
they were when copper reached the same price some years
ago. Calumet and Hecla stands some two or three hundred
points lower than it did then, and the same percentage
difference is manifest in the case of many other stocks.
But the explanation which the broker and market writer
offer is that people have awakened to the fact that mining
stocks are stocks with wasting assets, that the incomes from
copper stocks cannot, therefore, be capitalized on so high
a basis as similar incomes from other securities; that people
to-day realize this fact as they did not some years ago; that
the earlier capital-prices of copper stocks were vastly exaggerated
on the basis of a careful estimate of probable
total future income, etc. Japan, little used to the great
prosperity growing out of sudden great increases of special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[Pg 567]</a></span>
kinds of business, found herself in such an orgy of war
stock speculation that it was necessary to close the stock
exchange in 1915. The United States, better familiar
with the phenomena of boom and depression, seasoned by
many experiences of similar nature, have found that on
the whole,&mdash;at least in the opinion of many competent
judges in January of 1916,&mdash;war stock speculation has been
kept in reasonable bounds, thanks in large part to the conservatism
and caution of bankers and brokers, and that
the general economic situation is in fairly stable equilibrium,
with most of the probable sources of disaster foreseen
and "discounted." To "discount" is to make
"static"!<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> Whatever the business man can reduce to
bookkeeping terms, and whatever he can measure by
money in the market, the economist should be able to
bring within the "orderly sequences of economic law."</p>

<p>In <i>Social Value</i>, I have pointed out how wide is the scope
of the money measure. Waves of public opinion, of waning
or waxing hope and belief, of patriotic fervor, of religious
exaltation, of political movements of one or another kind&mdash;all
these find some sort of money measure in the market.
In the gold market in the early '60's in New York, the
"bulls" sang "Dixie," and the bears sang "John Brown's
Body"! It was patriotic to be a bear, and unpatriotic to
be a bull. These considerations affected the prices very
appreciably, at times, especially at the beginning of the
speculation in Greenbacks. Waning and waxing belief
in the triumph of the Northern armies manifested itself
very strikingly in the prices in the gold market, as W. C.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[Pg 568]</a></span>
Mitchell has conclusively proved, with a wealth of detailed
evidence, in his <i>History of the Greenbacks</i>. But in less
systematic markets, in less organized and regular ways,
many things besides are given a money measure: "Against
what, indeed, shall wealth be measured? Where are the
markets which measure its fluctuations?</p>

<p>"But such markets exist, always have existed. Are
there not streets where woman's virtue is sold? Are there
not commonwealths where there is a ruling price for votes?
Do not the comparative rewards of occupations indicate
what inducements will overcome the love of independence,
of safety, of good repute? We see men sacrificing health,
or leisure, or family life, or offspring, or friends, or liberty,
or honor, or truth, for gain. The volume of such spiritual
goods Mammon can lure into the market measures the
power of money.... When gold cannot shake the nobleman's
pride of caste, the statesman's patriotism, the
soldier's honor, the wife's fidelity, the official's sense of
duty, or the artist's devotion to his ideal, wealth is cheap.
But when maidens yield themselves to senile moneybags,
youths swarm about the unattractive heiress, judges take
bribes, experts sell their opinions to the highest bidder,
and genius champions the cause it does not believe in,
wealth is rated high." (Ross, <i>Foundations of Sociology</i>,
pp. 171-172.) Ross is here interested chiefly in the problem
of measuring the varying significance of wealth, symbolized
by money, in terms of other and non-economic, goods.
But it is equally true that money measures these goods.
The range of the money measure is very wide. Nor is it
confined to the exchanging process. Gabriel Tarde<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> has
pointed out that money may function as a measure of
non-material goods through gifts, public subscriptions, etc.</p>

<p>It is surely no extravagant claim to make that the meth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[Pg 569]</a></span>ods
of static economics may be extended at least as far as
the money measure goes! We shall later see reason for
believing that fruitful results may come from an even
wider extension of the static notion, at least as a schematic
device.</p>

<p>In reducing static and dynamic considerations to common
terms, we have now gone far. We have shown that a
wide range indeed of the phenomena deemed dynamic, and
largely ignored by current static theory, left to the discussion
of such innovating students of the "theory of
prosperity" as Veblen, are really in the actual practice of
the business world treated in the same way as are the
"static" phenomena of the values of physical goods and
concrete services. And we have further shown how wide
indeed is the scope of the static yardstick, the dollar. But
this is only a part of the story. We have generalized
statics. Can we similarly generalize dynamics? Or has
our generalization of statics merely narrowed the field of
dynamic considerations?</p>

<p>To this I reply that we may view the whole field likewise
from the angle of what we have called dynamics, or
theory of prosperity, or similar name. These terms are
not satisfactory, in my view, and I have already used terms
that appear to me better. My exposition on this point will
be briefer than in the generalization of statics, since I may
refer to what I have said elsewhere. In stating Veblen's
contrast between "business capital" and "the wealth of
nations," I quoted him as follows: "Under modern conditions
the magnitude of the business capital and its mutations
from day to day are in great measure a question of
folk psychology rather than of material fact." The capital,
or the wealth in general, of older and simpler days was a
material matter, concrete goods and services, in his view.
The newer items of capital are anomalies, presenting some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[Pg 570]</a></span>thing
strange and novel, and sinister. I should maintain
that, whether sinister or no, they are in principle at least
not <i>novel</i> or <i>anomalous</i>. <i>All economic values are matters of
folk-psychology!</i> All economic values are social values.
All are to be explained on the same general principles that
explain the values of the most complicated stock-market
phenomena&mdash;except of course, that the application of the
principles involves less complication in the case of such
values as that of a loaf of bread. But value is always a
matter of psychological significance, and never a matter of
mere material fact. And these psychological significances
are not explained by such simple individual phenomena
as labor-pain, or marginal utility, but always by reference
to the total social-mental system, including its laws, its
mores, its institutions, its centres of power and prestige,
its modes and fashions, etc. If Veblen has in mind the
contrast between goods whose values rest in labor-pain or
marginal utility, on the one hand, and values which rest
in a folk-psychology on the other hand, the contrast is a
false one. The first class does not exist. I shall not elaborate
this point. I have developed it at length in <i>Social
Value</i>, and in the chapter on "Economic Value" in this
book. I should make the contrast, then, which seems to
me to gather up the central significance of most of the contrasts
we have been discussing, as follows: on the one hand,
we may view the matter mechanically and abstractly, in
terms of the equilibration of values conceived of like physical
forces, expressed in prices; on the other hand, we may
view the economic situation more fundamentally and
realistically, seeing the interplay of men's minds, viewing
economic values as parts of a social mind, a functional unity
of many minds. We may treat society as a mechanism,
or we may treat it as a living, pulsing, psychological organization.
In short terms, our contrast may be between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[Pg 571]</a></span>
the theory of value, and the theory of price. And here we
are back to our thesis set forth on p. 559 of this chapter.</p>

<p>The theory of value, as thus marked out, is still an abstraction
from the totality of our cross-section picture of
social, or even of economic, life. The essence of society is
indeed psychological. But men have bodies, and live in a
material world, and have an elaborate technology. Many
of the factors which students of dynamics are concerned
with grow out of biological and technological relationships,
and are connected with physiographic influences. Can we
bring all these into our scheme? Giddings and Spencer
would answer affirmatively. For Giddings (<i>Principles of
Sociology</i>, ed. 1905, p. 363): "All social energy is transmuted
physical energy." Giddings guards himself (pp. 365-366)
against a thoroughgoing monism, which would leave
no distinction between mind and matter, but in general
he would hold to the scientific goal of reducing the physical
and psychical phenomena in society to a parallelism, so
that concomitant percentage variation could be predicated
of them, and so that considerations in one sphere
could be expressed by considerations in the other. In the
hands of Giddings and Spencer, such notions are handled
with caution and discrimination, and command respectful
consideration. One feels, however, that the starting point
is a monistic metaphysics, and that the philosophical doctrine
does not justify itself in its scientific application. In
the hands of such a writer as Winiarski, however (<i>Rev. Philosophique</i>,
vol. XLV, pp. 351-386; vol. XLIX, pp. 113-134;
summarized by Ross, <i>Foundations of Sociology</i>, pp. 156-157),
who makes all mental states mere forms of physical
energy, and applies to mental processes the laws of
mechanics, the doctrine becomes merely bad poetry! From
the standpoint of the needs of social science, and from the
standpoint of our present knowledge of social facts&mdash;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[Pg 572]</a></span>
say nothing of general philosophical considerations&mdash;it
seems clearly best to me to assume the common-sense
doctrine of dualism as a premise: mind and matter are two
different things; mind acts on matter, and matter acts on
mind. We are then at this position, when it comes to
bringing technological and physiographic factors into our
scheme: on the one hand, the values control technological
applications, and control the course of industry. New
technological devices will be employed when the present
worth of their anticipated products is great enough to overcome
the values that compete with them. Land will be
employed on that crop which gives the largest rent, etc.
Men's physical activities, and their employment of their
physical resources, are <i>motivated</i> by values. That is the
<i>function</i> of values. On the other hand, physiographic
and technological factors modify the lives and characters
of men and peoples. <i>Values</i> are in part controlled by physiographic
and technological conditions of life. But these
technological and physiographic factors, in order to influence
economic <i>conduct</i>, must first influence the value
system. This they do, (1) by affecting the quantities of
<i>objects</i> of value, and so modifying the marginal relations
among the value-scales and the marginal values; (2)
by affecting the lives of the people directly, and so modifying
the value-scales themselves. Similarly I see no way
of bringing the vitally important factor of heredity into
our scheme in a direct manner, <i>in propriore persona</i>, but
only mediately, as it (1) affects the character of the society,
and so changes its value-system or its technological activity
and volume of products, or (2) as heredity becomes a matter
of concern to the society, and so an object of value, with its
own place in the value-system.</p>

<p>There remains, therefore, in the field of technological,
biological, and physiographic features affecting economic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[Pg 573]</a></span>
life a considerable residuum of economic problems for
which, so far as I can see, no extension of the static method
can be devised. I propose no scheme of static price analysis
for balancing the effects of poor land and good heredity
on the character of a society.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> The problem must be approached
by other methods specially suited to it, which
we need not here discuss. But, given the values that rule
in that society, we may be sure that our static picture of
that value system will sum up much of the influence of the
bad land and the good heredity, mingled with the other
factors which have determined that set of values.</p>

<p>Once a factor has been introduced into the value system,
once it has modified the value-scales, we may treat it by
the methods of static price theory. The analysis of the
factors controlling the value-scales is the problem of value
theory. And here is, indeed, the central problem of the
"theory of prosperity." What are the causes controlling
the <i>mutations</i> of values? What factors cause values
to rise, intensifying economic activity, stimulating trade,
spreading prosperity? What brings about the crash in
economic values (and consequently in prices), in panics
and crises? Why the low values of the period of depression,
giving slight stimulus to industry and trade, leaving
economic life lethargic, inert? Increasingly it is recognized
that the problems are problems of values and prices.
It is no part of my plan to give answers in specific terms to
these questions. That were the task of a large book!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[Pg 574]</a></span>
And very much of it has already been done. It is my purpose
here, simply, to show that price theory, as developed
on the basis of static notions, may be extended, and has in
considerable measure been extended, to cover these problems,
and that for the same reason that price theory is
unable to give really fundamental answers to them, often,
it is likewise unable to give fundamental answers to the
value problem anywhere&mdash;that the phenomena of value
are of the same stuff and substance as the phenomena
treated by "dynamics" and "the theory of prosperity,"
and that static theory has been busied chiefly with a
limited portion of the field only because the problems were
easier there. Much has been made, especially in such a
book as W. C. Mitchell's <i>Business Cycles</i>, of technological
factors, and of factors in the psychology of the business man
and of the laborer in the ups and downs of business, and
particularly of certain elements of scarcity or overabundance
of productive resources at critical parts of the economic
system, which raise values and prices unduly at certain
points, compelling radical readjustments of values
and prices elsewhere. Virtually all of these considerations
will fit into the scheme here outlined. They work <i>through</i>
modifications of the system of values and prices. H. L.
Moore's recent <i>Economic Cycles</i> lays heavy emphasis on
physiographic factors, particularly variations in rainfall.
But these, too, act on the economic situation through
affecting the quantities of objects of value, and so through
modification of the marginal values of goods. The psychological
theory of economic value by no means excludes
any amount of influence one can find in physiographic or
technological factors.</p>

<p>One of the most important factors in the minds of many
writers who would treat business cycles, and a factor to
which virtually all writers give attention, is the waxing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[Pg 575]</a></span>
and waning of business confidence, and of the volume of
credit. I have given an extended analysis of the psychology
of confidence, and of the psychological nature of credit,
in my chapters on that topic. It is enough to say here
that we have in credit phenomena things which are of the
very stuff of economic values in general. Beliefs and hopes
are factors in economic values, and values wax and wane
with them. There is little indeed in the psychological and
institutional aspects of the theory of prosperity which an
adequate theory of value would not contain.</p>

<p>The theory of <i>prices</i>, as an abstract formula of description,
is of primary interest to the scientist, who has nothing
to do with the manipulation of concrete values, and who
has no interests at stake in the behavior of particular values
at a particular time. His purposes are ultimately practical,
no doubt, but the practical ends he has in view are,
after all, only to lay down general rules of public policy, of
a high degree of generality, and he consequently may abstract
from a great deal of the concrete causal process.
The theory of <i>value</i>, in its concrete fulness, is the special interest
of the active business man, and especially of the
business man who wishes, not merely to <i>adapt himself</i> to
changes in values, but also in part, to <i>control</i> and <i>manipulate</i>
those values. <i>He</i> must study every factor which does, in
fact, bring about changes in the value system. We do not
find the market-letter of a brokerage house, or the calculations
of a captain of industry, or trust promoter, troubling
themselves about marginal utilities or labor-pains! Notions
of supply and demand, and the relations of the prevailing
interest rate to the capital values of securities, they
do employ. Notions of money-costs of production they
make use of. But they also give very close attention to
questions of governmental policy, to court decisions, to
movements in the field of labor organization, to money<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[Pg 576]</a></span>-market
phenomena, and particularly to gold movements
and the state of the exchanges, to political campaigns, to
the strength of the prohibition movement, to changing
fashions and modes, and, above all, to the general <i>tone</i>,
the <i>consensus</i>, so far as it is ascertainable, as to whether
business is good or bad, whether men are buoyant or depressed,
to the ups and downs of business confidence. They
pay marked attention to the opinions expressed by certain
men, great bankers or industrial leaders, not merely because
they think these men good judges, but also, and in
part primarily, because these men are centres of power,
"radiant points of social control," whose opinions make
the opinions of others, and whose statements that times
are good tend to make them good, and that times are bad
tend to make them bad. For static theory, nothing is more
contemptible than the view which "demagogues" often
express in Congress that great men in Wall Street make and
unmake prosperity, bring about and check panics. For
static theory, the only way that big men can lower prices
is by selling, and the only way they can raise prices is by
buying.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> Their power to raise and lower prices is thus
limited by the amount of their wealth which they are willing
to employ in this way. As it is not likely to be profitable
to be a bull when the general condition of the "fundamentals"
calls for falling prices, and as bear operations,
contrary to the fundamentals, are likewise usually costly,
the inference would be that the big men will not, even if
they could, alter the course of the market. Their wealth
is, after all, not so tremendous, as compared with the aggregate
wealth of the rest of the community. But the market
takes the big men more seriously! When they are selling
heavily, other men are often <i>afraid</i> to buy, such is their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[Pg 577]</a></span>
prestige. When they give out opinions, these opinions
<i>become</i> the opinions of a host of others, almost automatically.
When Morgan stepped into the breach in the Panic
of 1907 with $25,000,000, it was quite as much the fact that
<i>Morgan</i> had acted, as it was the millions themselves, which
relieved the situation. Indeed, it was in no small degree
the prestige of Morgan which relieved the <i>disorganization</i>,
which restored the discipline, and made it possible for the
elements in the market to work in harmony and co&ouml;peration
again. Society is a functional unity, and the "tone
of business," the ups and downs of prosperity, depend in
large measure indeed on the degree to which the lines of
communication between the different parts are kept open,
on the question of whether each part does its expected task
at the right time and in the right way, on the all-together-functioning,
the <i>integration</i>, of the elements. These are
phases of the matter from which static theory abstracts.
They are organic problems, not mechanistic problems. Of
course, mechanisms get out of order too. But tightening
a bolt is a very different thing from restoring confidence
and discipline to a market!</p>

<p>Those who wish to control values have their own technology.
There is a technology of industry, a mechanical
technology, running in terms of pistons and levers and
soil-fertility-equivalents, and butter-fat-content, and ton-miles,
which is governed by the values. But there is also
a technology of <i>controlling</i> values which involves advertising,
making sentiment, keeping up social discipline,
effecting the equilibration of values by exchange, keeping
"interstitial" adjustments smooth, which involves a different
kind of activity, thought, and ability, and which employs
different instrumentalities. Its problems are problems
of human nature and social relationships, its laws are
psychological laws, particularly the laws of suggestion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[Pg 578]</a></span>
imitation, and the like, its tools are the newspaper, the
sign-board, the whispered word, the cigar and the dinner
with wine, sound logic, money and credit instruments, the
prestiges of men and institutions. For men whose work
lies in controlling and making values, rather than in making
passive technical adjustments to existing values, the theory
of value, as I have defined it, is of supreme importance.</p>

<p>This, I may say for the critic who may consider the social
value theory a highly speculative and theoretical notion,
does not mean that the active business man or the advertising
writer, has formulated the social value theory in
terms of a social mind, conceived of, in the light of modern
functional psychology, as a functional unity of individual
minds! The advertising writer is a student of modern
psychology, and reads books on the psychology of advertising,
which discuss the psychology of suggestion, and the
like. But long before such books were written for him, he
studied the phenomena involved in his own way. It is
not his business to construct a theoretical economics! It
is his business to make a market for his wares. He is interested
in the scientific theories of modern social psychology
only in so far as they help him in that task. He has
no occasion to construct a vast conspectus, which shall
summarize the whole economic situation, in its social
setting. But my point is, simply, that the kind of phenomena
which he does study are indicated and stressed and
brought into a system in the theory of social value which I
have tried to elaborate. As his purposes are different
from those of the economist, his method of approach, and
his range of investigation, will necessarily be different.</p>

<p>The notion of dynamics has been in a way connected
with the idea of evolution, of historical process in time,
while the notion of statics has been essentially connected
with the notion of a cross-section, a stage, an equilibrium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[Pg 579]</a></span>
of contemporary forces. How, then, bring the two together?
Of course, we may conceive the evolutionary
process itself as a series of stages, and the mind does tend
almost inevitably to do that. The fact is, of course, a perpetual
flow, with unceasing change. The mind grasps such
a notion with difficulty, if at all. Logic is mechanical and
mathematical, and mathematics and mechanics are static.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a>
But further, we may in large measure bring the historical
considerations into a cross-section picture, when it is a value
system that is involved. <i>Past</i> facts exert their influence
through <i>present</i> values; and <i>future</i> facts, which may be
expected to modify future values, come into the present
equilibrium as discounted <i>present</i> worths.</p>

<p>When we view the situation realistically, moreover,&mdash;which
means, when we view it as a living organic, psychological
process,&mdash;our cross-section does not need to be narrowed
to a moment of time. We may see the values not
yet in stable equilibrium, but in process of equilibration,
with marginal values and prices fluctuating, tending toward
a static goal, but hindered by various cross-currents, of
"friction," of uncertainty, of momentary values which
rest on beliefs regarding the process of transition itself&mdash;as
when a "bull" on the war-stocks turns bear temporarily,
because he thinks that prices may fall before recovering
themselves, and going higher. We may see obstacles in the
way of readjustment whose importance is itself subject to
static measure&mdash;labor temporarily out of work, and labor-time
lost, at so much per day; uncertainties which give
rise to speculation, which calls for the employment of extra
banking credit, at such and such per cent; capital-instruments
which have to be "scrapped," representing the loss
of so many dollars. We may see the process of building<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[Pg 580]</a></span>
up new trade connections, at such and such a cost, to replace
others which formerly functioned, but which no longer
serve, which were once worth so much, and which now are
valueless. Watching the realistic process of transition,
through a period of time, we may still apply our static
yardstick to many of its features.</p>

<p>Above all, do we get in this connection a realization of
the fact that the "immaterial capital" of which Veblen
speaks is true social wealth.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Whatever is necessary for
the carrying on of economic life, whatever, if destroyed,
must be replaced, before the economic process can go on,
and will be replaced by the expenditure of labor and thought
and money, is capital. The sales-force is as truly a part
of the labor-force of a corporation as are the mechanics.
The trade connections which the sales-force has built up
is as truly a part of the capital of the business as the machines
which the mechanics have made. The static theory
which abstracts from this easily leads to dangerous conclusions.
Removing a tariff may well, <i>after the transition is
completed</i>, give a greater productive efficiency to a country.
But what of the cost of transition? May not the values
destroyed, and to be recreated, in the form of trade connections,
social organization, accomplished adjustments, and
the like, be greater than the new values to be gained by
better adaptation of industry to the physical resources or
the capacities of the labor supply, of the country? In large
measure, this question, in a given case, is susceptible to a
quantitative answer. The statesman who reckons only
the gains which the final static adjustment will bring, and
neglects the costs of reaching it, costs not alone in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">[Pg 581]</a></span>
"scrapped" machines, but also, in "scrapped" social organization,
has missed a substantial part of his problem.</p>

<p>The theory of prosperity, and the theory of value, are
largely concerned with just this system of social control,
by means of which value scales are altered, and by means
of which altered values are brought into a new equilibrium.
It is a complicated fabric of psychological relationships,
partly institutionalized, partly non-institutional. The
institutions&mdash;as banks, big corporations, speculative exchanges,
and the like, are the nuclei, about which centre
much that is temporary, shifting, and flexible. Given
time, the whole system is highly flexible&mdash;it is organic, and
not mechanical.</p>

<p>The serious injury of this system in a country may well
be a greater disaster than the destruction of physical items.
Let unscrupulous men&mdash;or misguided men&mdash;bring about a
legal repudiation of debts, and the disaster may be greater
than the destruction of a city by an earthquake. That
creditors have been robbed is a minor matter, but that
credit has been shaken, so that men will fear to lend again
or to sell except for cash, may well mean industrial paralysis.</p>

<p>Considerations like these enable us, in substantial degree,
to reduce "transitional" considerations to common terms
with "normal" considerations. We can apply the static
measure to the "transitional considerations," and we find
the values which come into equilibrium in the "normal"
period to be generically like those whose variations interest
us in the period of transition. Indeed, the "normal
equilibrium," if it were ever reached, would also contain
these intangible capital items, though many of them would
be much reduced, since the work that they have to do
would be largely gone, if the normal equilibrium were persistent.</p>

<p>It does not follow from the foregoing that many of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[Pg 582]</a></span>
elements in "modern business capital" are not, as Veblen's
analysis suggests, sinister and anti-social. To say that
their values are true social economic values, generically
the same as the values of wheat or corn or whiskey or
opium or Sanatogen or milk or tickets to burlesque shows,
or silver sacramental sets, or Ford automobiles, is not
necessarily to give them a good moral character! Some of
these intangible capital goods are thoroughly anti-social,
and should be destroyed. This is particularly true of
monopoly power, and of popular brands whose value rests
in popular delusion. But even here, caution is needed.
Is it socially wise to destroy a wine cellar, containing an
hundred thousand dollars worth of fine wines, even assuming
that Demon Rum is as black as he is painted, and that
Veuve Cliquot is his favorite daughter? Will not the
economic values which have been destroyed in this moral
fervor be recreated? And will not this tend to divert labor
and capital from the creation of a corresponding amount of
more wholesome economic goods? Might it not be wiser
from the standpoint of the temperance movement itself,
to sell the wine cellar&mdash;at private sale, of course!&mdash;and use
the proceeds in the campaign fund of the prohibition party?
Of course, there is more still to the story. The destruction
of the wine cellar may be done so dramatically, and may be
so well advertised, that it will arrest public attention, and
tend to create new social values, of a moral and legal sort,
which will prevent the recreating of that wine, by changing
the direction of demand, and by lessening the sources of
supply. Similarly with trade connections, and other intangible
capital items. If destroying one means merely
that labor and capital will be employed in making others
no better, the social gain is very doubtful. And some sort
of system of control of interstitial adjustment, of overcoming
friction, etc., there must be.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[Pg 583]</a></span></p>

<p>I wish to contrast the view I have been here presenting
with that developed by Schumpeter, in his <i>Theorie der
Wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung</i>. In Schumpeter's view, the
division between statics and dynamics is much more than
methodological. The phenomena of statics and dynamics
are different phenomena. Statics is concerned with the
influence of individual utility-scales, or utility-scales and
psychic cost-scales, hedonistic phenomena. Dynamics is
concerned with the influence of "<i>energisch</i>" (as distinguished
from "<i>hedonisch</i>") factors. (<i>Loc. cit.</i>, 128.) Most
men are moved by hedonic considerations. Their economic
activity tends toward the equilibrium described in
static theory. Seeking to maximize satisfactions, and to
minimize pains, they tend to get into the "best-possible"
situation ("best-possible" under the "given conditions")
and stay there. The "energetic" type of men, moved by
motives like love of activity for its own sake, love of creative
activity, love of distinction, love of victory over others,
love of the game, etc., undertake activities which tend to
alter the "given conditions" themselves, to alter the structure
and technique of economic society, to introduce new
ways of doing things, and so to break the static equilibrium.
This last type of men is small in number, but tremendously
important. Schumpeter's theory of value
rests solely in an analysis of the hedonic factors mentioned,
conceived of as individual psychological magnitudes. I
have discussed his theory of value in the chapter on "Marginal
Utility" in this book, and would refer to that discussion
here. He makes virtually no use of the value concept
there developed in explaining the causation of dynamic
change, but instead, as I have pointed out in that chapter,
invents new concepts, which do the work of the value
concept, which he calls "<i>Kaufkraft</i>," "<i>Kapital</i>," and
"<i>Kredit</i>," which do not rest on marginal utility, but rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[Pg 584]</a></span>
on the activities of certain centres of economic power, particularly
of banks.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> His picture of economic evolution is
that of a conflict between these static and dynamic forces,
between "utility-curves" and the psychological factors of
the "energetic" type, the former represented in a set of
static price-ratios, the latter in a set of dynamic "powers,"
conceived of, not as sums of money (even though expressed
in money-terms), but as "abstract power," which grows,
not merely out of the individual psychologies of the entrepreneurs,
but also, and primarily, out of the social influence
centered in the banker. This power which the banker
to-day supplies was in earlier periods supplied by the political
power of the despot, and is distinctly a matter of social
organization, and social control, an over-individual, social
phenomenon, analogous to the "social value" which I
have sought to put behind all prices, whether "static" or
"dynamic." The dynamic man needs "power," either
political or financial, to "force" the "static" men out of
their accustomed ways of activity. They fear and resist
him. He must coerce them. The contrast is thus sharply
made between abstract price-ratios, resting on individual
feeling-scales, and quantitative "powers," measured in
money, resting on a social basis. Between the factors
underlying static prices, and those underlying dynamic
prices there is, thus, nothing in common. Statics and
dynamics are concerned with fundamentally different phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[Pg 585]</a></span>If my criticisms of the utility theory of value are sound,
and if what has gone before in this chapter holds good, we
must restate Schumpeter's contrast.<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> The static tendencies
do not rest on any peculiarities of the psychological "stuff"
from which static values are derived. They rest rather
in the universal tendencies of all values, whatever the
psychological factors behind them, to come to an equilibrium.
The reason that values, whether they be the values
of new and novel things, or the values of old and familiar
things, tend to come to an equilibrium is that gains come
from equilibrating them. When some values are too low,
and some are too high, the opportunities for speculative
gain are evident. Arbitraging transactions, as between
different places, time-speculation, transferring labor and
capital from one enterprise to another, increasing the
supplies of some goods and reducing the supplies of other,
changing land from wheat to corn, etc., etc.,&mdash;all these
things are sources of gain, and they will be done, whatever
the origin of the values involved. The new, dynamic
enterprise, before it becomes actualized in concrete machinery,
factory building, etc., and long before its income
is actualized in money-receipts from the goods it is destined
to produce, becomes an <i>object of value</i>. The value is a
<i>future</i> value. But it comes into the present as a discounted
present worth. As such it functions like any other value,
tending to attract in its own direction the land, labor and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[Pg 586]</a></span>capital necessary for its realization. It does not differ in
its functioning from the present worths of future goods of
familiar sorts.<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> It tends, after a process of re&euml;quilibration&mdash;which
Schumpeter, with his theory of crises, has done
much to elucidate&mdash;to come into equilibrium with the older,
"static" values, becomes itself a static value. Indeed,
from its inception, it comes under the static, money measure.
It enters at once into the scheme of static values and
prices, even though it causes readjustment there.</p>

<p>The pre&euml;xisting static values are themselves to be explained,
not as growing out of individual feeling-scales,
but as growing out of a complex social psychology, in which
some men and groups of men have vastly greater social
"power" than others. The pre&euml;xisting static values are
of the same stuff as the dynamic values. But this has
already been made clear.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The possibility of presenting an equilibrium picture of
social forces, to the extent that those social forces submit
themselves to the money measure, the possibility of applying
the methods of static price-theory wherever pecuniary
concepts may be carried, does not exhaust the possibilities
of the static notion, at least as a schematic device. There
are many social values, particularly in the legal and moral
sphere, which do not readily come under the money measure,
and where such measurements as may be made in
money terms seem obviously inadequate. Of these values,
as of all values, however, the law of equilibration holds.
<i>All</i> tend to come into adjustment of a sort that will allow
the maximum of values to be realized. Something of the
exactness of the static method has recently appeared in a
decision by a famous jurist, confronted with the fact of
the conflict of two legal principles. Most judges would go<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[Pg 587]</a></span>
on the legal theory that there can be no conflict in the laws
of a single sovereign. Of course, we have courses in "Conflicts
of Laws" in our law schools, but the subjects treated
in such courses relate to conflicts, say, between the laws of
New York and the laws of New Jersey. When a judge is
presented with a case of conflict between two laws of New
York, he will commonly feel it to be his duty to "remove"
the conflict, by making distinctions, till the conflict is
whittled away. Not a little bad law has thus originated!
The law is "absolute." It knows no exceptions. It does
not obey the law of diminishing significance. Of course,
"<i>de minimis non curat lex</i>," but that means, not that there
is a delicate margin, where the law ceases to apply, but
merely that the law disregards trifles too insignificant to
attract its attention at all. They are, in mathematical
phrase, "infinitesimals of the second order," discontinuous
with the interests of magnitude great enough to attract
the attention of the law. There is little room in such a
legal theory for notions of the sort discussed in this chapter
to find place! But a different theory of the law is implied,
and partly expressed, in a recent decision by Mr. Justice
Holmes: "All rights tend to declare themselves absolute
to their logical extreme. Yet all in fact are limited by the
neighborhood of principles of policy which are other than
those on which the particular right is founded, and which
become strong enough to hold their own when a certain
point is reached. The limits set to property by other
public interests present themselves as a branch of what is
called the police power of the State. The boundary at
which the conflicting interests balance cannot be determined
by any general formula in advance, but points along
the line, or helping to establish it, are fixed by decisions
that this or that concrete case falls on the nearer or farther
side.... It constantly is necessary to reconcile and adjust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[Pg 588]</a></span>
different constitutional principles, each of which would be
entitled to possession of the disputed ground but for the
presence of the others." (Hudson County Water Co. vs.
McCarter, 209 U. S., 349, 1908.) Here we have a scheme
very like that of static economic theory! "The boundary
at which the conflicting interests balance"&mdash;the <i>margin</i>
where the curves of diminishing value of the two legal
principles intersect! A plurality of legal values, in marginal
equilibrium! Lacking a tool of thought so convenient as
money has proved for the economist, the jurist finds trouble
in making his margins precise. He is dealing with quantities
for which he has found no common measure. There
is no "standard or common measure" of legal values.
Hence, most lawyers content themselves with qualitative
reasoning, seeking to avoid the necessity of quantitative
weighing and comparison of the factors in their problem
by making distinctions of <i>kind</i>. Mr. Justice Holmes
recognizes the necessity and the existence of legal <i>quantities</i>,
and of making quantitative distinctions, <i>i. e.</i>, distinctions
of <i>degree</i>. He sees a generic essence common to the whole
body of laws, such that marginal equilibria are possible and
actual.</p>

<p>So far we have a static system of laws. But the same
writer, in a later decision, has said: "And yet again the
extent to which legislation may modify and restrict the
uses of property consistently with the constitution is not a
question for pure abstract theory alone. Tradition and
the habits of a community count for more than logic."
(Laurel Hill Cemetery <i>vs.</i> San Francisco, 216 U. S. 358,
1910.) As these traditions and habits of a community
may change, so may the legal values change, and new
equilibria need to be reached in a process of readjustment.</p>

<p>But further, in this view, and in the view of the best
students of jurisprudence in general, the legal values are not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[Pg 589]</a></span>
an insulated, self-contained system. In the sentence last
quoted, Justice Holmes sees their root in a total social situation.
And it is easy to show that economic values, in
particular, are part of that social situation out of which
legal values derive their power. Legal values enter into
economic values. Economic values enter into legal values.
And between legal values and economic values are marginal
equilibria. There is a vast social system of values, legal,
economic, moral, religious, etc., in constant dynamic
change, but tending also to static equilibrium. Changes
at any part of the system compel readjustments throughout.
The process of equilibration is often slow, but slow
or rapid, smooth or violent, it is in constant process. For
the further elaboration of notions like these, I refer again
to my <i>Social Value</i>. Here, as in the narrower economic
sphere, we have men and institutions whose chief activity
is concerned with the manipulation and control of these
values, with effecting the readjustments, and bringing
about the re&euml;quilibrations. They have their appropriate
tools and technology. Money and credit are merely part
of a much wider system concerned with social control and
social adjustment!</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>To summarize: The problem of this chapter has been
to harmonize statics and dynamics, the "theory of wealth"
and the "theory of prosperity," "normal" and "transitional,"
and similar notions, commonly held to belong to
different spheres, and to be incapable of reduction to common
terms. A number of such contrasts have been passed
in review, and numerous illustrations of the various types
of contrast have been given. It is the contention of the
present chapter that the most fundamental of these contrasts,
and the one which gathers up the meaning of most
of them, is that between the theory of value, and the theory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[Pg 590]</a></span>
of price. The theory of value is dynamic, is concerned
with the phenomena of prosperity and depression, is
realistic enough to deal with transitions and readjustments;
the theory of price is static, and rests in the notion of accomplished
equilibrium, abstracting from the problems of
friction and transition. The reconciliation comes from
two angles: on the one hand we have generalized price
theory, showing that in large measure the phenomena
with which value theory, theory of prosperity, dynamics,
deal come under the money measure, are made "static"
by "discounting," and by the application of accounting
principles; that this tends to be more and more true as
knowledge grows more accurate; that "statics" means
especially quantitative, as opposed to merely qualitative,
thinking. We have shown further that the static schema
is applicable even where the money measure is inapplicable,
and even beyond the economic sphere, as illustrated
by a recent decision of Justice Holmes. The other angle
of approach was to universalize value theory, dynamics,
theory of prosperity, by showing that all prices, whether
"static" or "dynamic" have the same fundamental sort
of explanation, that value is always a matter of social psychology,
and never a matter of mere individual psychical
magnitudes, or of "material fact." This is not to deny
that physical facts have their bearing in the scheme:
(a) they are among the objects of value, even though not
the only objects, and (b) material facts, technological, physiographic,
and biological, are the basis on which human
nature rests, out of which it has developed, even though
human culture including social values has increasingly
emancipated itself from immediate dependence on them,
and has acquired a partially independent movement of its
own. The effort was not made to reduce mind and matter
to common terms, but the case was rested in an irreducible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[Pg 591]</a></span>
dualism, and the causal influence of non-mental factors on
the value-scales themselves cannot be measured by the
static scheme. The static scheme, assuming the value-scales,
gives a precise answer as to the influence of the
quantities of physical objects on the marginal values.
The significant fact about the values with which dynamics,
theory of prosperity, etc., deal is that they are the values
of immaterial social relationships and institutions, in large
part, which are concerned with the problems of social
adjustment and control, with affecting equilibria in the
economic sphere, with overcoming the friction and effecting
the transitions from which static theory abstracts. This
is a phase of production quite as important as the physical
activities of laborers or machines. It has its own technology,
appropriate to its problems. In particular, money
and credit are part of its tools. Since its problems are to
control men's minds, it uses psychological forces. Where
the mechanic uses a storage battery, charged with electricity,
to move material things, the technologist of economic
readjustment employs a dollar, charged with social
value, which is power over the action of men. It is as a
bearer of value, in form adapted to the problem, that is in
highly saleable form, that the dollar functions. It is the
psychological significance of the dollar, and not its physical
qualities <i>per se</i>, that enables it to do its work. The physical
weight in gold, which itself is an object of social value,
is commonly the immediate basis of the value of the dollar
to-day, but money may get its primary value from other
sources than valuable bullion. Given this primary value,
the dollar may get an enhancement in that value from the
services which it performs in the social technology of
adjustment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[Pg 592]</a></span></p>

Professor Cooley's articles, which I have listed first in this note, have in
certain important particulars shifted the emphasis and changed the method
of approach. He is more interested in the general sociological aspects of the
value problem than in the technical economic aspects. In considering economic
value, he is more interested in its general social functions than in its
function as a tool of thought for the economic theorist. He has, therefore,
been less bound by schemata than I have in the discussion. This different
method of approach, coupled with a singular charm in exposition which
characterizes everything Professor Cooley writes, makes it seem probable
to me that readers who may find the doctrine as I set it forth unconvincing,
will be convinced by Professor Cooley's exposition. I hope, too, that Professor
Cooley's articles, which have been scattered among three periodicals,
may soon appear together under one cover.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Including many whose formal definitions are quite different, and who
would repudiate the contentions here advanced! <i>Cf.</i> my article, "The Concept
of Value Further Considered," <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>, Aug.
1915, and <i>Social Value</i>, chs. 2 and 11.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Definitions of wealth differ, and there are few if any definitions of wealth
broad enough to make it true that only items of wealth have value. All
wealth has value, but not all value is embodied in wealth. Thus, stocks
and bonds, and "good will" have value. Few writers would classify them
as wealth. The distinction between wealth and property is employed by
many writers to meet the difficulty here presented, and it is held that these
intangibles have only the value of the wealth to which they give title. In a
logical schema, on the assumption of a fluid, static equilibrium, this may
serve. It is true in fact, however, that many of these intangibles have value
apart from the wealth to which they give title. But these are complications
which I reserve for a later part of this chapter, for the chapter on "Statics
and Dynamics," and (in the case of irredeemable paper money) for the
chapter on "Dodo Bones."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The notion of ratio of exchange as a ratio between values is strictly
accurate only under static assumptions. Goods, in actual life, are not always
exchanged strictly in accordance with their values. <i>Cf.</i> my article, "The
Concept of Value Further Considered," <i>Q. J. E.</i>, Aug. 1915, pp. 698-702.
In cases where prices, or exchange relations, are not in accord with values,
the term "ratio of exchange" is inapplicable, since there are no quantities
to be terms of the ratio&mdash;except the pure abstract numbers of the commodities,
each measured in its own unit, exchanged.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> In chapter 17 of <i>Social Value</i>, I have followed the German usage in
broadening the term, price, to cover all exchange relations. This has led
to misunderstanding on the part of some readers, and it has seemed best to
me to return to what appears to be the more familiar usage. It is purely a
question of convenience. Practically, ratios of exchange which are not
money-prices rarely come in for discussion, outside the preliminary chapter
on definition! Professor Fetter, in his article on the "Definition of Price,"
in the <i>American Economic Review</i>, Dec. 1912, proposes to broaden the term
price in the manner which I am here abandoning, and his count of economists
would seem to leave usage about equally divided between the broader and
narrower uses of the term. It does not seem to me to be a point worth
arguing about, however, and since I am practically convinced that cause
of misunderstanding will be removed by using price to mean "money-price,"
I shall so use the term in this book, using ratio of exchange, or exchange
relation, to express the broader concept.</p></div>

Aug. 1915. Professor Clark seems to agree with much of what
has been said here, and the present writer would agree with Professor Clark,

prices&mdash;entering a <i>caveat</i> that this is true only so long as we can assume a

of this extreme individualism in economics. Individualism is nearly
dead in modern political, ethical, and sociological theory. Revivals of it
appear, however, in W. Fite, <i>Individualism</i>, and in a recent article by R. B.
Perry, "Economic Value and Moral Value," <i>Quart. Journal of Economics</i>,
May, 1916. (I have discussed Professor Fite's views in the <i>Pol. Sci. Quart.</i>
of June, 1912.) Professor Perry would there appear to reduce ethical value
to a purely individual phenomenon. But he really brings in a "categorical
imperative," not derived from the values of the individual, by the "back
door." "Now our general moral law prescribes that an agent shall take
account of all the interests which his conduct affects, or shall judge his
conduct by its consequences all round." (<i>Loc. cit.</i>, p. 481.) Just how this
"general moral law" is to be derived from individual values, is not made
clear. That the wants of every man should count equally with the wants
of the agent is a principle which one would expect from Kant or Fichte, but
hardly one which individualism can expect to maintain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45" id="Footnote_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> I am here abstracting from an important factor, namely, that not all
prices are affected equally by changes in the value of money. Some prices
are fixed by law and custom, and some incomes are tied by long time contracts.
Thus, it will happen, in many cases, that supply and demand for a
given good will be unequally affected by a change in the value of money.
This means that certain values are <i>tied</i> to the value of money, rising and
falling with it, so that the amount of <i>power</i> which some elements in the
economic situation are able to exert through supply-price-offer and demand-price-offer
are at the mercy of changes in the value of money. But this is
an element which is incalculable, on the basis of the supply and demand
concepts, and must be abstracted from if we are to make any definite assertions
as to the effect of increase or decrease of demand in the active
sense on supply in the passive sense, or vice versa. Unless we make this
abstraction, and unless we assume a fixed value of money, we might find
increase of demand in the active sense (nominal) leading sometimes to an
increase, and sometimes to a decrease of supply in the passive sense, or
rather, being accompanied by either increase or decrease of supply in the
passive sense. No law would be possible. In practice, both of these abstractions
are more or less consciously assumed.</p></div>

inclusive, was almost 15c. per lb.; the average price of spot cotton in New
York during the same months in 1911-12 was not quite 10 cents per lb.
On this basis, the eleven million odd bales of 1910-11 sold for substantially
more than the fifteen million odd bales of 1911-12.</p></div>

analysis to the notion. We shall discuss the capitalization theory as we

the capitalization theory, which it is unnecessary, for present purposes, to
consider. One interesting line of doctrine is that developed by DR Scott
(<i>Jour. of Pol. Econ.</i>, Mar. 1910) and H. J. Davenport (<i>Yale Review</i>, Aug.
1910), in which ordinary formulations are criticised as assuming a "social
rate" of interest, and in which the effort is made to work the thing out on
the basis of extreme individualization, each man having a rate of discount
of his own. I have accepted the doctrine in the general form in which it
has been developed by B&ouml;hm-Bawerk (in criticism of Turgot and Henry
George in his <i>Capital and Interest</i>), by Fetter, in his <i>Principles of Economics</i>,
and by Fisher in his <i>Rate of Interest</i>, abstracting from points on which these
writers disagree. My criticism of their doctrines, were it necessary here to
develop it, would rest on the ground that their treatment of the general
interest problem is too individualistic, and I should side with them as against
Scott and Davenport. But these matters are aside from our present problem.

to the social value concept of the present writer that the social mind concept
of Giddings and Lewes bears to the social mind concept of the present
writer. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Social Value</i>, ch. 9. Wieser's concept excludes individual
peculiarities. It is an abstraction from individual values, a distillation of
their common essence. The social value concept of the present writer is a
focal point in which are summarized all the individual values, whether alike
or divergent, and not merely the individual marginal utilities of the goods
in question (Wieser's only factors) but also the individual emotions which
affect the distribution of wealth. Wieser's concept is based on a study of
individual marginal utilities considered as atomic elements; that of the
present writer looks on the social mind as an organic whole, in which individual
mental processes are phases, and does not try to synthesize a social
value out of elements, but rather, to analyze it into elements. In the function
in economic theory for which they are destined, however, the two concepts
have much in common. Both seek to be the fundamental economic
quantity. Both seek to be causal forces, lying behind prices, even though
expressed in prices; both oppose the conception of value as merely relative.</p></div>

Quarterly</i>, Dec. 1915. Schumpeter's theory, as there presented, is based
on the brief discussion in his <i>Theorie der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklung</i> (Leipzig,
1912), pp. 61 et seq., 105, 166-667, 116, 464, and on Schumpeter's verbal
expositions of the theory during his American trip. Since that account was
published, Professor W. C. Mitchell has given an account of Schumpeter's
doctrine, based on the fuller discussion in Schumpeter's <i>Wesen und Hauptinhalt
der theoretischen National&ouml;konomie</i>, which is in accord with the account
here given. (Mitchell, in <i>Papers and Proceedings</i>, Supplement to March,
1916, <i>American Econ. Rev.</i>, p. 150.) Mitchell attributes the essential elements
of Schumpeter's theory to Walras. The first exposition in English
of the conception, so far as the present writer is aware, is in Irving Fisher's
<i>Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices</i>, <i>Trans. Conn.
Acad. of Arts and Sciences</i>, 1892. Professor Fisher, in his preface, accords
priority to Jevons, Auspitz and Lieben, and to Walras. The conception is
not to be found in Jevons, though many of the ideas involved in it are. The
first non-mathematical exposition of the doctrine, so far as I know, is by
Schumpeter. As will be made clear in a footnote at the end of the present
chapter, neither Wicksteed nor Davenport has really forced the problem
through, to the full equilibrium picture, and neither has escaped the Austrian
circle. I do not concur with Professor Mitchell's interpretation of
Wicksteed on this point. It may well be that mathematical method, with
a system of simultaneous equations, was necessary for the development of
the idea. If so, it illustrates both the strength and the weakness of mathematical
economic theory: it clarifies thinking, but it gets no causal theory!
At all events, no causal theory emerges in this case.</p></div>

the distribution of the landed and other instrumental, income-commanding
wealth in society, but also the distribution of general purchasing power ... are,
at any moment in society, to be explained only by appeal to a <i>long and
complex history</i> [italics mine], a distribution resting, no doubt, in part upon
technological value productivity, past or present, but in part also tracing
back to bad institutions of property rights and inheritance, to bad taxation,
to class privileges, to stock-exchange manipulation ... and, as well, to every
sort of vested right in iniquity.... <i>But there being no apparent method
of bringing this class of facts within the orderly sequences of economic law, we
shall&mdash;perhaps&mdash;do well to dismiss them from our discussion</i>....' [Italics are
mine.] It may be questioned if the 'orderly sequence' is worth very much if
it ignore facts so decisive as these! It is precisely this sort of abstractionism
which has vitiated so much of value theory. Most economists slur over the
omissions; Professor Davenport, seeing clearly and speaking frankly, makes
the extent of the abstraction clear. We venture to suggest that the reason
he can find no place for facts like these within the orderly sequence of his
economic theory is that he lacks an adequate sociological theory at the
basis of his economic theory. A historical <i>regressus</i> will not, of course, fit
in in any logical manner with a synthetic theory which tries to construct
an existing situation out of existing elements. Our plan of a <i>logical</i> analysis
of existing psychic forces makes it possible to treat these facts which have
come to us from the past, not as facts of different nature from the 'utilities'
with which the value theorists have dealt, but rather as fluid psychic forces,
of the same nature, and in the same system, as those 'utilities.'"</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_104" id="Footnote_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> A possible exception to this general statement might be made
for Professor H. J. Davenport, who would insist that his version of
the utility theory is based on "relative marginal utility," rather than
on marginal utility in B&ouml;hm-Bawerk's fashion. No critic has been
more merciless than he in the criticism of the Austrian confusions
of demand-curves with utility-curves, etc. But it is not clear to me
that Professor Davenport has freed himself from the general doctrine
that he criticises. I am not sure that he would accept Schumpeter's
version of the Austrian theory as correct. It may be possible to <i>read</i>
Schumpeter's doctrine <i>into</i> chapter 7 of Davenport's admirable <i>Economics
of Enterprise</i>, but it is not clear that one could read it <i>in</i> the
chapter! That individual price-offer depends on the marginal utilities
of alternative goods, in comparison with the marginal utility of the
good in question, Davenport does emphasize. But the complication
that not merely the utilities of alternative goods, but also their <i>prices</i>,
have to be taken into account, and that this involves circular reasoning
when an effort is made to give a summary of the whole system of
prices by means of individual utility calculations, he does not, so
far as I can see, grapple with. He summarizes the thing on p. 104:
"The steps, then, are from (1) utility to (2) marginal utility, thence
to (3) the comparison of marginal utilities, and finally to (4) price-offer."
He takes no account here of the complication that the third
step is in large degree a comparison, not of marginal utilities proper,
but rather, of "subjective values in exchange." Yet just in this lies
a vital difficulty of utility theory, in so far as it attempts to explain
causation. Moreover, Professor Davenport is seeking to explain
the <i>causal</i> relation of utility to <i>demand</i>, the old Austrian problem.
The explanation of demand is, indeed, the problem with which all
theories of value must come to terms, if they are to be of any use.
As we have seen, Schumpeter's schema has no bearing whatever on
the explanation of demand, or on <i>causation</i> of any sort. Schumpeter's
scheme leaves money out, and demand-curves run in money terms.
Davenport's scheme assumes money&mdash;and "purchasing power."
(<i>Loc. cit.</i>, 91.) We have seen in the chapter on "Supply and Demand"
that the notion of demand and supply involves money and a fixed
absolute value of money. Professor Davenport is thus doubly assuming
value, the thing to be explained! Laws of "relative marginal
utility" developed on the assumption of money, and in abstraction
from changes in the value of money, are not likely to be of service
when the problem of the value of money itself is taken up. On pp.
95-96, Davenport comes closest to Schumpeter's doctrine, saying that
"the total situation is directive of each individual in it," and that
there are "mutual reactions," such that particular facts are both effects
and causes, illustrated by the last person who jumps on a crowded
raft&mdash;does he sink the others, or do they sink him? This recognizes
the complexity of the problem, but it is not clear that it even purports
to do more than that. What is called for is a <i>definition</i> of the essential
elements in that "total situation," with precise statement as to what
is assumed constant and what is allowed to vary, and an analysis of
the "mutual reactions," with a starting point and a <i>terminus ad
quem</i>,&mdash;an equilibrium in which "mutual reactions" cease to trouble
with their endless circle! Schumpeter's schema, though meeting
criticism on other scores, does meet this logical test, but Davenport's
does not appear to do so.
</p><p>
It is interesting to note that Professor Alvin S. Johnson, in his
review of the <i>Economics of Enterprise</i>, concludes that Professor Davenport,
instead of meaning by "relative marginal utility" anything
of the sort that Schumpeter has in mind in his equilibrium picture
of all utilities to all individuals, really has an absolute value in mind.
(<i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i>, May, 1914, pp. 433-436.) There is
much in Professor Davenport's book to justify this interpretation.
</p><p>
Professor Davenport's application of "utility" to the problem
of the value of money will be found on pp. 267-275 of the <i>Economics
of Enterprise</i>. The general discussion of money and credit in the
<i>Economics of Enterprise</i> has been exceedingly illuminating to me, and
my indebtedness to it will appear in the present book.
</p><p>
Much of what has been said of Davenport's "relative utility"
theory may also be said of Wicksteed's. (<i>Common Sense of Political
Economy</i>, London, 1910.) This is in many ways a remarkable book,
characterized by excellencies of many different sorts. But it fails
to present the utility theory in such a way as to avoid circular reasoning.
Wicksteed sees the confusion of utility-curves with demand-curves,
and protests vigorously and at length against it. (<i>E. g.</i>, pp.
147-150.) He starts out by assuming money and a set of market
prices. His earlier chapters are given to showing how the individual
adjusts himself to the market, bringing his "marginal utilities" of
various goods into harmony with the market prices. He recognizes
that he has made these assumptions (pp. 130-131), and that he cannot
use the results thus achieved as an explanation of the market prices.
They are "our goal, not our starting point." But by pp. 161-162 he
finds himself with the "suspicion" that nothing special or peculiar
is to be found in the laws of "market or current prices&mdash;a phenomenon
which it is obviously impossible to regard as ultimate, which
demands explanation, and which we have not yet explained....
Much remains to be done, but we can already see that the preferences
of each individual help to determine the terms or conditions under
which the choice of other members of the community must be exercised.
If you take the individuals of the community two and two
it is clear that the marginal preferences of each determine the limits
within which direct exchanges with the other can be entertained, and
we must already have at least a presentiment that the collective
scale is the register of the final and precise 'resultant' of all these
mutually determining conditions and forces."
</p><p>
This seems to forecast Schumpeter's doctrine, but in the development
which follows, we do not find it. The heart of his analysis of
the causation of prices is in ch. vi, on "Markets." The "summary"
which precedes that chapter again suggests Schumpeter's analysis&mdash;the
notion of an all-embracing equilibrium. But when we get into
the detailed analyses of the chapter we find nothing more than an
exceedingly good account of the process by which supply and demand
of particular goods, considered separately, become equated,
through two-sided competition, and under conditions of monopoly.
Instead of "relative marginal utilities," we see customers coming into
the market with various money-prices in mind, and sellers trying
out various money-prices&mdash;not marginal utilities, nor yet two or
more marginal utilities in comparison with one another, but rather,
money-prices, which, in the minds of the buyers may be supposed
to represent "subjective values in exchange," based on both marginal
utilities <i>and</i> objective prices of other things that enter into the budget,
and which, in the minds of sellers, represent estimates of the
prices which buyers may be induced to pay. Wicksteed does not
transcend the circle. Finally, despite his caution to avoid the more
glaring forms of the circle, and the confounding of demand-curves
with utility-curves, and of utility with value, he does lapse into it in
its completest form in expounding the Austrian doctrine of cost of
production. "The only sense, then, in which cost of production can
affect the value of one thing is the sense in which it is itself the value
of another thing. Thus what has been variously termed utility,
ophelemity, or desiredness, is the sole and ultimate determinant of
all exchange values." (P. 391.) Here is the illicit leap from marginal
demand price to marginal utility which all utility theorists make,
sooner or later! It is true that costs in one place are reflections of
<i>demand</i> elsewhere. But it is not true that costs in one place
have any definite quantitative relation to <i>utilities</i> in another
place!
</p><p>
When Wicksteed comes to discuss the value of money, he makes
slight use of the notion of abstract ratios among relative utilities,
and employs a concept which he has nowhere vindicated or explained:
the <i>value</i> of money, as distinct from the reciprocal of the price-level,
treating the value of money as something which can be directly influenced
by sinister rumors affecting the credit of the Government, and
which can be an independent cause affecting velocity of circulation,
and the amount of trade done by means of money. <i>Loc. cit.</i>, p. 623.
See <i>infra</i>, our chapter on "Velocity of Circulation."
</p><p>
The only writers I know at first hand who have really thought the
thing through, and avoided the circle in form, are Schumpeter and
Irving Fisher. (<i>Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value
and Prices</i>, <i>Trans. Conn. Acad. of Arts and Sciences</i>, 1892. See bibliographical
note, <i>supra</i>, in this chapter.) I have given an exposition
of Schumpeter, rather than Fisher, because the former has put the
doctrine in non-mathematical form. In the text I have indicated
the limitations of their doctrine. Fisher definitely avows the impossibility
of applying the doctrine to the problem of the value of
money. <i>Purchasing Power of Money</i>, p. 174. Schumpeter doesn't
apply it to money, and when he tries to work out a utility doctrine
of money, he lapses into the Austrian circle in a very obvious form.
In later writings, Fisher also seems to forget the limitations imposed
on utility theory in his earlier essay. In his <i>Elementary Principles</i>,
ed. 1912, Fisher lists (pp. 408-409) a great multitude of factors that
might affect the price of pig iron, and then says: "Back of these
causes lie other causes, multiplying endlessly as we proceed backward.
But if we trace back all these causes to their utmost limits, they will
all resolve themselves into changes in the marginal desirability or
undesirability of satisfactions and of efforts, respectively, at different
points of time, and in the marginal rate of impatience as between
any one year and the next." Here these marginal psychic
magnitudes, which in the earlier essay appeared merely as surface
phenomena, resultants of a total situation, proportional to prices,
causes of nothing, merely symptoms of a completed equilibrium, are
erected into atomic <i>ver&aelig; caus&aelig;</i>, the ultimate ultimates!
</p><p>
It is interesting to contrast this with a yet more recent statement
by a philosopher who has undertaken a defence of the utility
theory of economic value, Professor R. B. Perry, in the <i>Quarterly
Journal of Economics</i>, for May, 1916. Considering the contentions
of the present writer that many general social causes, in addition
to the individual utilities concerned with consumption, are needed
to explain changes in the values of goods, such as changes in fashion,
mode, in general business confidence, in moral attitude toward different
sorts of consumption, in the distribution of wealth, in taxes
and other laws, Professor Perry says: "If the Austrian School has
neglected this, then it needs to be corrected. But the essential
contention of that school remains, so far as I can see, unaltered; <i>in
that these changes work through individuals</i> and have their <i>point of
application</i> in a more or less rational <i>comparison of needs</i> made by the
<i>individual buyer or seller</i>. Whatever affects these <i>individual schedules</i>
on a sufficiently large scale will affect prices. But to ignore the individual
channels through which these forces pass, is elliptical."
(Pp. 469-470. Italics mine.) Now I call attention to several points
in the foregoing. First, I would contrast it with the doctrine quoted
from Professor Fisher's <i>Elementary Principles</i>. Where Fisher puts
the utilities far back in the realm of ultimate causation, making them
the source from which spring all the proximate social causes which
might affect the price of pig iron (such as "a trade war," "a change
in fashion," a "change in incomes," "decreasing foresight," etc.,
<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 409), Professor Perry would make individual utility schedules
the final focal point, toward which converge, and through which
pass, all the causal forces, however richly explained by antecedent
social factors, which affect prices. The utility theory of value means
all things to all men!
</p><p>
But a second point with reference to Professor Perry's doctrine.
It is perfectly true that <i>all</i> social activities are the work of <i>individuals</i>.
Society is nothing apart from the individuals who make it up. To
think of society and the individual as separate and antithetical is a
fallacy which I have criticised in detail in Part III of <i>Social Value</i>.
The social value theory does not mean that there are social forces
which do not run through individual channels. This is not to accept
the notion that individuals are really, in their psychical nature, isolated
monads, however. There is a functional unity of individual
minds, and no individual can be understood in abstraction from society.
But this view is as old as Aristotle. I have not contended
that prices can change apart from the mental activities of individual
men, working upon one another. So far there <i>may</i> be no issue with
Professor Perry.
</p><p>
But there is a big issue when he contends that all the causation
is focussed in <i>individual utility schedules</i>, and in a more or less rational
comparison of needs made by the <i>individual buyer and seller</i>. This is
<i>demonstrably erroneous</i>. Let us assume, for example, that utility schedules
of every individual New Yorker remain unchanged, but that,
through a change in the law (the work of individual men, under the
influence of their own individual emotions and ideas, of, say, ethical
character), incomes in New York City are <i>equalized</i>. Hold rigidly
to the assumption that there are no changes in utility schedules.
Will there not be, none the less, a radical readjustment of prices?
Will not the prices of Riverside palaces and steam yachts sink and
the prices of things which the poor esteem rise? The utility-curves
of the erstwhile rich, assumed to remain unchanged, no longer count
for so much as before in the market. The rich cannot go so far down
their curves in the consumption process as before. The poor, or those
who had been poorest, now count for more in the market. They can
lower their margins. In other words, the forces affecting the distribution
of wealth, in so far as they are legal and moral in character,
at least, may affect the price-situation, <i>without</i> altering <i>utility schedules</i>.
Some social factors, as changes in mode and fashion, will work <i>through</i>
the utility schedules, but others will not. One big <i>variable</i> affecting
prices which need not, in idea, at least, affect utility schedules at all,
and whose main influence is anyhow not directed through them, is
the volume of business confidence. This factor we shall analyze in
our discussion of credit, <i>infra</i>. Professor Perry thus escapes only
part of the criticism which we have made (<i>Social Value</i>, pp. 45 and
56) of the Austrian theory: (1) that it abstracts the individual from
his vital contacts with other individuals, and (2) that, within the
individual mind thus abstracted, the Austrians make a further abstraction,
taking as relevant only the interests concerned with <i>consumption
of economic goods</i>, summed up in the utility schedules. The
second criticism applies to Professor Perry as well. Men's total interests
are not summed up in utility schedules, and do not affect
prices exclusively <i>via</i> utility schedules.
</p><p>
It may be noticed, also, with reference to Professor Perry's discussion
that he has misconstrued the Austrian theory in conceiving
it as an analysis of an historical <i>process</i>, with a beginning
and an end, instead of a static picture, in which pre&euml;xisting individual
factors come into equilibrium. (<i>Loc. cit.</i>, 475.) He seeks
thus to avoid the Austrian circle, but as we have shown in the discussion
of von Mises in the text, this way is not open to the Austrians.
</p><p>
Able and penetrating though Professor Perry's discussion is, on
the psychological side, it fails, I think, to take adequate account of
the complexities with which the economist and sociologist must
deal.
</p><p>
In general, I find no version of the utility theory of value which is
defensible, and, above all, no effort to apply it to the value of money
which has met with success.</p></div>

toward different kinds of money cannot be predicted with any certainty,
and there seems to be absolutely no definite or universal law governing
the matter. The present writer collected a lot of newspaper clippings
at the outbreak of the present World War. From these it appears that in
both Paris and Berlin there was a very great distrust of bank-notes, and an
insistence by retailers, restaurants, landladies, etc., on <i>coin</i>. But <i>silver</i>,
which was not standard money, seems to have been accepted without question.
When hoarding is referred to in these clippings, it is invariably gold
that is mentioned. A similar hoarding of gold took place during the Balkan
crisis at the time of the outbreak of the war between the Balkan Allies and
Turkey. Professor E. E. Agger informs me, however, that he has found
some evidence that bank-notes as well as gold were hoarded in Austria, at
this time.
</p><p>
Sometimes we have a suspension of Gresham's law, and an acceptance
of all kinds of money at varying ratios. The following clipping from the
<i>Boston Herald</i> of March 17, 1914, illustrates this: "Douglas, Ariz., March
16.&mdash;Four kinds of money are now circulating in the Mexican territory controlled
by the Constitutionalists. These are United States currency, the first
issues of the Constitutionalist government and of Sonora state, and 'Villa
money,' or that issued by Chihuahua at the instance of the rebel military
commander. United States takes precedence. Merchants in Sonora, in
order to protect themselves and at the same time observe the laws requiring
acceptance of the rebel currency issues, have established a sliding scale of
prices. This was discovered when five merchants were arrested at Cananea
by Constitutionalist secret service men, who found that for American money
they could buy goods for less than half the amount exacted when payment
was offered in Mexican currency. The uncertainty of the rebel campaign
against Torreon is reflected in the money market. To-day Constitutionalist
sold for 22 and 28 cents American on the peso. Mexican federal currency
commanded from 30 to 32 cents." In the experience of travellers who have
discussed the matter with the writer, there was little of this flexibility of
relation between paper money and coin in Berlin, or Paris at the outbreak
of the present War. Where paper was refused, it was absolutely refused,
and where it was accepted, it seems to have been accepted without discount.
No doubt, a fuller investigation would reveal all manner of variation in the
behavior of different people in different centres, and at the same centres, at
the outbreak of the War.</p></div>

in the United States by taking banking transactions as representative of

Professor Fisher maintains that the overcounting to which I call attention
is offset by undercounting, and considers offsetting book-credits, which
actually dispense with the use of money and checks, an important element
in the undercounting. I am unable to reconcile this position with the reasons
given for excluding book-credits from the "equation of exchange." A detailed
discussion of the points at issue appears in later chapters, particularly
in the chapter on "Statistical Demonstrations of the Quantity Theory."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_164" id="Footnote_164"></a><a href="#FNanchor_164"><span class="label">[164]</span></a> Kemmerer (<i>Money and Credit Instruments</i>, p. 80) maintains that, "under
perfectly static conditions," money in circulation and money in bank reserves
will keep a fixed relation to one another. He offers no argument to
support this view. Of course, "under perfectly static conditions," everything
keeps in fixed relation to everything else. The volume of credit will
keep a fixed relation to the number of laborers and to the supply of clocks.
But this would hardly establish causal connections! Fisher multiplies "fixed
relations" of various kinds, without, so far as very diligent search can tell,
offering any argument to support them. Thus, we have on p. 105 the statement,
"We have seen that normally the quantities of other currency are
proportional to the quantity of primary money, which we are supposing
to be gold." Where this thesis has been demonstrated, he does not indicate.
In view of the fact that gold has been the one really flexible element in our
money supply, the thesis is hardly credible. On pp. 146-147, facing this difficulty,
Fisher says: "Since, however, almost all the money can be used as
bank reserves, even national bank-notes being so used by state banks and
trust companies, the proportionate relations between money in circulation,
money in reserves, and bank-deposits will hold approximately true as the
normal condition of affairs. The legal requirements as to reserves strengthen
the tendency." Here is a very substantial growth in the doctrine, with only
one new argument, namely, that concerning legal reserve requirements&mdash;which
gives minimal ratios, not <i>fixed</i> ratios. In what way the fact that
most kinds of money can serve as legal reserves gives reason for the doctrine
of fixed proportions is not made clear. For Professor Fisher, however,
it seems quite enough, for on p. 162, in the heart of his causal theory, he
boldly announces: "There must be some relation between the amount of
money in circulation, the amount of reserves, and the amount of deposits.
Normally <i>we have seen</i> that the three remain in given ratios to each other."
(Italics mine.) It is doubtless somewhat dangerous to make a confident
negative statement concerning a book which has no index. But careful
reading of all that has preceded this statement reveals no references to this
topic except those quoted above. "We have seen" is not a legitimate premise
when so important an issue is involved. In our discussion of reserves
in the section on credit, as well as in the discussion of the volume of trade,
it will appear that no "normal" or "static" relations of this kind are possible.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_201" id="Footnote_201"></a><a href="#FNanchor_201"><span class="label">[201]</span></a> The foregoing had been written before the discussion in the <i>Annalist</i> of
Feb. and March, 1916 (pp. 183-184, 245-272, 313-317, 344, 377), in which
Professor Fisher and the present writer joined issue with reference to Professor
Fisher's estimate, 387 billions, for the volume of trade in the United
States in 1909. The present writer contended that the banking transactions
which Professor Fisher took as representative of trade greatly overcounted
trade, since they included loans and repayments, taxes, several checks
in one transaction, gifts, etc., etc. Professor Fisher contended that the
overcounting was offset by undercounting, and instanced particularly the
clearing-house arrangements in the speculative exchanges, where checks
are in part dispensed with, and the offsetting in "running accounts" through
book-credit. This indicates a substantial change in Professor Fisher's view
as compared with that set forth in the <i>Purchasing Power of Money</i>, where
he maintains, as shown above, that barter is virtually non-existent, that
money and checks are "for all practical purposes and all normal cases,"
"necessities of modern trade," (p. 160), and that book-credit merely postpones,
and does not dispense with, the use of money and checks (p. 370).
</p><p>
The extent of the offsetting by barter, clearing-houses in the exchanges,
and book-credit, though very great, is quite small as compared with Professor
Fisher's 387 billions, and does not nearly offset the overcounting.
The writer has obtained some fairly definite data on this point, which will
be presented in the chapter on "Statistical Demonstrations of the Quantity
Theory," in discussing the volume of trade.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_204" id="Footnote_204"></a><a href="#FNanchor_204"><span class="label">[204]</span></a> One familiar feature of corporation finance makes barter much preferable
to money transactions, in one connection, which involves very many
corporations indeed, at their inception. Stock, in order to be marketable,
must be "full-paid and non-assessable." If the corporation sells its stock
to the first stockholders, this means that money must be paid for it to the
full par value, dollar for dollar. This is usually not easy. An especial difficulty
would then present itself that the promotor would have trouble in
getting any pay for his work. (Meade, <i>Corporation Finance</i>, <i>passim</i>; Sullivan,
<i>American Corporations</i>, <i>passim</i>.) If, however, the stocks are paid for
in <i>goods and services</i>, the courts are much less exacting in looking to see if
full value has been received. Barring obvious fraud, the courts will usually
count the stock full paid and non-assessable even though the value of the
goods and services received is not very great. The first sale of the stocks
of a new corporation, therefore (if it is important enough to wish to have
a public market for its stocks), is a <i>barter</i> transaction, as a rule.</p></div>

Standard of Value</i>, London, 1912, p. 43. Barbour denies vigorously that
more money can increase business, since it cannot increase the number of
laborers, or of machines, or the amount of food, etc. The doctrine that
volume of trade is fixed by (1) volume of products, and (2) degree of specialization
of production, and hence is independent of volume of money, appears
in Davenport, <i>Econ. of Enterprise</i>, 271-273.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_230" id="Footnote_230"></a><a href="#FNanchor_230"><span class="label">[230]</span></a> In this view, Fisher typifies the general position of the quantity theory,
and, indeed, in part even of those who do not agree with the quantity theory,
but who, with the quantity theorists, view the problems of money and
banking as matters of static theory. High or low prices, once the transition
is made, exhaust the effects of increasing or decreasing the money supply.
During the period of transition, certain readjustments in relations between
creditors and debtors arise, which lead to either temporary prosperity or
temporary distress, but after the transition, it is a matter of indifference
whether or not money is abundant. Though the view is, logically, an essential
part of quantity theory reasoning, we find much of it vigorously
maintained by Laughlin, <i>Principles of Money</i>, ch. on "Amount of Money
Needed by a Country." Laughlin and Fisher would seem to be at one in
maintaining that the quantity of money in a country is a matter of indifference,
and from the views of both would follow a condemnation of the
idea that any long run consequences for volume of trade, efficiency of production,
etc., could follow from increasing or decreasing the volume of money.

that the relation between the quantity theory and the bimetallic movement
is historical rather than logical. Indeed, in laying the stress they did on the
importance of an inadequate stock of money in accounting for the depression
of the latter part of the 19th Century, the bimetallists were out of harmony
with the quantity theory.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_234" id="Footnote_234"></a><a href="#FNanchor_234"><span class="label">[234]</span></a> The fact that prices are often high in gold mining regions, as compared
with prices in the general world markets, has been taken by many writers
as proof of the quantity theory. <i>Cf.</i> Kemmerer, <i>Money and Credit Instruments</i>,
pp. 50-51, 58; Cairnes, J. E., <i>Essays in Political Economy</i>, particularly the discussion of the Australian episode. It seems to me that this is
particularly inconclusive. High prices characterize remote mining regions
of all kinds, whether gold, silver, copper, diamonds, tin or what not be the
quest. Prices are not lower in the tin and copper region in the northern
part of the Seward Peninsula in Alaska than they are in the gold region
about Nome in the southern part of that peninsula. They are high in both
places, not because of the abundance of gold or of money, but because of
the great value of goods, which have to be brought with great trouble and
expense from the United States. They are higher in the region of the Saw
Tooth Mountains, in the centre of this peninsula, where hydro-electric
power for the use of the gold miners about Nome, and for the copper and
tin mines further north, is being developed, than they are at Nome itself,
on the coast, where the gold is being mined. They were high in Australia
because the discovery of gold led everybody to abandon everything but
gold mining, and to bring in virtually everything from a distance. Wooden
beams were imported to Australia from Sweden! (Pierson, N. G., <i>Principles
of Economics</i>, I, p. 389.) One would expect prices in gold money to be
higher in a silver or copper mining region, which is prospering, than in a
gold mining region, equally remote, where a great deal of gold is being mined,
but at a cost too great to make the region prosperous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_247" id="Footnote_247"></a><a href="#FNanchor_247"><span class="label">[247]</span></a> In a letter to the writer, Professor Fisher states that the figures for the
physical receipts at the cities, which dominate his index for T, have not
been available for recent years, and that since they were discontinued, he
has relied chiefly on the indirect calculation of T <i>via</i> the other factors in
the equation. These figures were discontinued in 1912. In the <i>American
Economic Review</i> for June, 1916 (p. 457, n.) Professor Fisher states that
the indirect calculation of T has always had more weight in his figures than
the direct calculation. This would serve in some degree to lessen the errors
of his index of variation. The extent to which he has allowed his T as directly
calculated on the basis of the index to be modified by the indirect
calculation, is indicated on p. 302 of the <i>Purchasing Power of Money</i>, as
follows: "The alterations in T, as shown in Figure 16, though still greater
than the preceding, are nevertheless so small and uniform as to preserve
an almost perfect parallelism between the original and the altered curve.
The differences rarely exceed 10%." Even an indirect calculation of
T, however, would not avoid the criticisms here urged, since the other
factors, MV, M&acute;V&acute;, and P are all, as we shall see in the chapter on "Statistical
Demonstrations of the Quantity Theory," calculated by methods
which give very excessive weight to trade outside New York City and to
non-speculative transactions.</p></div>

The account above given is strictly accurate only for that part of T, 353

however, is also based on Kinley's figures. My account here is adequate
for the question at issue, which is, not as to the absolute magnitude of trade,

in the <i>Annalist</i> of Feb. 21 and March 13, 1916. Professor Fisher does not
question my contention that speculation makes up the overwhelming bulk
of trade, in these replies. He rather seeks to meet the charge of overcounting
by holding that bank-transactions do not fully count speculation! This he
thinks particularly true of stock exchange transactions. <i>Cf.</i> his article of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_257" id="Footnote_257"></a><a href="#FNanchor_257"><span class="label">[257]</span></a> The coefficient of correlation has been developed by the biologists, chiefly
Karl Pearson, but has been applied to problems in many fields, especially
economics, sociology, psychology, and education. A good source is Yule's
<i>Introduction to the Theory of Statistics</i>. Professor H. L. Moore has made
extensive use of the method in his <i>Laws of Wages</i>, and his <i>Economic Cycles</i>.
</p><p>
Connected with the coefficient of correlation, usually, is a figure for
"probable error," which depends, primarily, on the square root of the number
of observations. When the probable error is low, and the coefficient of
correlation high (as .8), it is commonly supposed that a very high degree of
causal connection is established. I shall not go into detail in discussion of the
method. My personal judgment is that it is overrated, that "spurious"
correlations, leading to quite erroneous conclusions, have frequently resulted
from it, and that the labor involved in calculating coefficients of
correlation is frequently too great for the results obtained. I should never
be disposed to accept conclusions based on a "correlation coefficient" unless
there were other converging evidence to support it. In effect we have, in
the coefficient of correlation, nothing more than a refinement of the method
of comparing two curves on a graph. The curves tell the story, in a general
way, whereas the coefficient of correlation sums up all the comcomitant
variations (and disagreements) in one figure. The eye does not readily
compare the degree of relation between two curves with the degree of relation
between two others. When it is desired to know which, of several relationships,
is closest, the graphic method, or the method of comparing
series of figures, burdens the attention. The coefficient of correlation condenses
the information to such a degree as to make comparison easy. It is,
then, merely a refinement of familiar statistical methods. Used wisely,
guided by sound theory, it aids in presenting facts. It enables us to state
quantitatively things we already know qualitatively. But there is no magic
in it! As I have mentioned both Mr. Silberling and Professor Moore in this
connection, it is proper to say that both of them are fully alive to the dangers
and limitations of the method, and that Professor Moore emphasises
strongly the need for sound <i>a priori</i> testing of hypotheses before submitting
them to the test of correlation. One danger, that of getting a high correlation
merely because both of the variables compared are <i>growing rapidly</i>,
has been avoided by Mr. Silberling by the use of successive <i>percentage</i> deviations,
instead of absolute figures. For reasons explained by Mr. Silberling
in a footnote, he uses, instead of the "probable error," a statement of the
number of observations. Thus, "r = .78 (46)" means that the coefficient
of correlation is .78, and that there are 46 observations for each of the two
variables compared.</p></div>

figures are from the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i>, unless otherwise
stated. King's estimates are for 1910. The other figures are for 1909.
Compare this list with my discussion in the <i>Annalist</i>, March 6, 1916, p. 317,
where I made computations purposely much too large. In that computation
I clearly greatly exaggerated salaries and professional incomes, and
rent as well as retail and wholesale trade. My figure there included the
rent of houses as well as the rent of land. King's figure is only for land
rent. However, in view of the fact that a high percentage of real estate
is used by the owner, with the result that no rent-payments are required,
I think King's figure high enough for the whole item.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_270" id="Footnote_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> Professor Fisher has estimated total real estate exchanges in the country
at less than 1% of the total 387 billions (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 226), and
a colleague of the Harvard Business School has given me an estimate of
$1,300,000,000 for total advertising in the United States. Neither of these
items is properly counted part of the "static" trade that would occur were
things in "normal equilibrium." If, however, we counted them, we should
add only 1%, say, of the total. When it is seen how insignificant,
in comparison with the 387 billions indicated by deposits, the figures for
total manufactures, total farm products, and total wages, are, there really
is little need to argue the case. It is impossible to find, in the "ordinary
trade" we have not mentioned, items whose total will equal the least of
these three. Moreover, we have allowed for a multitude of these items in
permitting the figure for retail trade to be as high as it is, and have left large
leeway in making no deduction for the speculation in wholesale trade, and
in counting farm products in full. Interest and dividends I have not counted.
They are not "trade." When we have counted stock sales, we have already
counted the exchanges in which dividends were sold. The man who buys
the stocks has already bought the dividends. To count the dividends in
addition would be a case of that double counting of capital and income
against which Professor Fisher has warned us in his <i>Nature of Capital and
Income</i>. Rents and wages represent payment for current services, and are
properly items of trade. Interest and dividends are one-sided money payments,
completing transactions for which money has already passed, and
in which a man is merely getting a delivery of something he has already
bought. In general, loans and repayments are not properly counted as
part of ordinary, or physical trade. If, however, we counted total corporate
dividends and interest we should get only $4,781,000,000 (King's estimate,
<i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 262). This is a little over 1%. What else is there? In his
article of March 13, 1916, in the <i>Annalist</i>, Professor Fisher failed to meet
my suggestion that a bill of particulars was called for!</p></div>

money system, will affect the volume of trade. "There have been times
in the history of the world when money was in so uncertain a state that
people hesitated to make many contracts because of the lack of knowledge
of what would be required of them when the contract should be fulfilled.
In the same way, when people cannot depend on the good faith or stability
of banks, they will hesitate to use deposits and checks" (78). But there is
nowhere an admission that the <i>amount</i> of bank-credit has any influence
on the volume of trade, and there are repeated assertions, as already instanced
in the text, that the volume of trade is quite independent of the
volume of money and bank-credit.</p></div>

written, Professor W. C. Mitchell has presented an admirable historical
paper on "The R&ocirc;le of Money in Economic Theory," in which he has multiplied
instances, in the history of the science, of this contempt for money,
or abstraction from money, in economic theory. He finds that Marshall,
and some other later writers, have given much fuller recognition to the r&ocirc;le
of money, which he conceives of primarily as an institution which has rationalized
economic behavior, by forcing upon the individual bookkeeping
habits of thought. This still leaves it legitimate to abstract from money,
however, for "pure theory." Highly important as is the "measure of values"
function, it does not explain the main work which money, as money, actually
<i>does</i> in economic life, nor need it be a source of value for money. <i>Cf.</i>,

and Financial Chronicle</i>, rather than from Government reports, in order to
get figures for calendar rather than fiscal years, and in order to get the latest
possible figures. As the absolute figures are not strictly comparable throughout,
the method employed has been to calculate <i>percentage</i> gains or losses
for the <i>same roads</i> for successive years. This would lead to a cumulative
error, if large new roads had been built during the period, and had retained
their independence. In point of fact, however, the curves for the absolute
figures and for the percentage changes run pretty closely parallel down to
1909, at which time a large number of small roads, not previously counted,
are brought into the figures. As the number of roads reported varies, the
percentage changes on the same roads give us the more accurate measure of
year by year variation. It is, at the date of writing (December, 1916), the
only possible method for 1916, since the <i>Chronicle</i> figures which come to
the end of November are based on only 37 roads, with a mileage of 84,452
out of over 240,000 miles usually reported. For these roads, a gain of
19.63%, for the first eleven months of 1916 over the same months in 1915,
is reported, and our figures for 1916 rest on the assumption that the gain
for the whole year over 1915 is 17.27%. (The greatest gains are for the
earlier months, as the end of 1915 was a period of great activity.) Much
fuller figures supplied me by Mr. Osmund Phillips, of the <i>New York Times</i>,
for the first <i>ten</i> months of 1915 and 1916 serve to justify this estimate for
the gain of 1916 over 1915. For the <i>Chronicle</i> data, see vol. 102, p. 930,
vol. 103, p. 2112, and <i>passim</i>.
</p><p>
The index of prices chosen is Dun's. (See especially <i>Dun's Review</i> of
May 11, 1907, Jan. 9, 1915, and later months, and the discussion of Dun's index
number in the <i>Bulletin of the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics</i>,
Whole Number 173, July, 1915, pp. 148 <i>et seq.</i>) Dun's index number is chosen
partly because it is complete for 1916, and partly because it is weighted
in accordance with the consumption of different classes of goods, and so
particularly suited to this inquiry. I venture to express strong preference
for rationally weighted index numbers, and for the use of different index
numbers for different purposes. (<i>Vide</i> the discussion of index numbers in
ch. 19.) Our price index for each year is an average of the twelve monthly
figures given by Dun from 1894 to 1916. For the years 1890-94, our
price index is an average of the figures for January and July. This average
is lower, in most years, than the average for the whole year, and may well
be lower than the average for these years, but no attempt has been made
to rectify this possible source of error. The index is recalculated from Dun's
figures (where it is not a percentage, but a sum of prices), and made a true
percentage index, with a base in 1910.
</p><p>
The figures for exports and imports are for <i>calendar</i> years. They were
obtained, for the years 1890-1909, from <i>Statistics of the United States, 1867-1909</i>
(National Monetary Commission Report), and, for the years since
1909 from the <i>Commercial and Financial Chronicle</i>. For 1916, November
and December are estimated.</p></div>

of Money</i>, ch. 7, on the "History and Literature of the Quantity Theory,"

principle and the quantity theory.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_322" id="Footnote_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_322"><span class="label">[322]</span></a> It may be that in the brief discussion of elastic bank-notes on p. 173
(<i>loc. cit.</i>), Fisher means to given an explanation of the theory of elasticity
from a quantity theory standpoint. The statement there is that money
not only tends to flow away from <i>places</i> where prices are high, but also from
<i>times</i> when money is high. "If the price-level is high in January as compared
with the rest of the year, bank-notes will not tend to be issued in
large quantities then. On the contrary, people will seek to avoid paying
money at high prices and wait till prices are lower. When that time comes
they may need more currency; bank-notes and deposits may then expand to
meet the excessive demand for loans which may ensue. Thus currency
expands when prices are low and contracts when prices are high, and such
expansions and contractions tend to lower the high prices and to raise the
low prices, thus working toward mutual equality."
</p><p>
If this be the quantity theory account of elasticity&mdash;and it would seem
to be about the only thing the quantity theory could say&mdash;it is about as
far from giving an account of the real facts as any theory could be! Something
of this sort is suggested, perhaps, by the behavior of Canadian bank-notes,
which do expand in the fall, when prices of wheat are lowest, and
contract in January, when wheat prices are higher. This grows, however,
out of the peculiarities of an agricultural country, and does not at all illustrate
the general doctrine maintained. First, wheat prices in the fall are
low because wheat is most abundant then. Wheat prices in January, under
the influence of speculation, commonly differ from wheat prices in the fall
by an amount about equal to the elevator charges, rattage, insurance, interest,
and other carrying charges involved. Second, wheat prices are only
one element in the general price-level. Low wheat does not prove that the
level is necessarily low. A good wheat crop may mean increases in general
prices, and often does. Third, and more important, the real reason for an
expansion in Canadian notes at such a time is that the wheat <i>has to be moved</i>.
The farmers do not want to carry it; the speculators are ready to carry it;
and it must be sold. Expanding <i>trade</i>, at the season, is the cause of expanding
bank-notes. The influence of the <i>price</i> of wheat is exactly the reverse of
that which Fisher assigns. If the price of wheat is low in the crop-moving
season, <i>less</i> notes will be issued than if the price is high. In other words,
the greater the increase in PT, not P or T alone, the greater will be the
expansion of bank-notes. Decrease either P or T, and less notes will be
issued.
</p><p>
In general, the phenomenon of elastic bank-credit is the phenomenon
of an expanding bank-note or deposit issue accompanied by rising prices
and volume of trade, and a decrease when trade and prices decrease. This
is all commonplace, but I feel it best to refer to familiar sources to show how
old and well recognized my statement of the case is. The following is from
Mill's <i>Principles of Economics</i>, Bk. III, ch. 24, par. 1: "Not only has this
fixed idea of the currency as the prime agent in the fluctuations of price
made them shut their eyes to the multitude of circumstances which, by
influencing the expectations of supply, are the true causes of almost all
speculations and of almost all fluctuations of price; but in order to bring
about the chronological agreement required by their theory, between the
variations of bank issues and those of prices, they have played such fantastic
tricks with facts and dates as would be thought incredible, if an eminent
practical authority had not taken the trouble of meeting them, on the
ground of mere history, with an elaborate exposure. I refer, as all conversant
with the subject must be aware, to Mr. Tooke's <i>History of Prices</i>.
The result of Mr. Tooke's investigations was thus stated by himself, in his
examination before the Commons Committee on the Bank Charter question
in 1832; and the evidences of it stand recorded in his book: 'In point of fact,
and historically, as far as my researches have gone, in every signal instance
of a rise or fall of prices, the rise or fall has preceded, and therefore could
not be the effect of, an enlargement or contraction of the bank circulation.'"
</p><p>
I see nothing in Fisher's discussion of credit to differentiate it from the
position of the old Currency School. And the reason is a very simple one:
Fisher has followed the quantity theory to its logical conclusions!</p></div>

Professor Mitchell's chart, <i>Business Cycles</i>, p. 344. The same chart exhibits
the variations in the reserve percentage, which is very much greater.
The New York Clearing House banks, which we have seen (<i>supra</i>, "Volume
of Money and Volume of Credit") have a spread of from 24.89% to
37.59% in the yearly average of percentage of reserves to deposits&mdash;a
spread of over 50%&mdash;show a variation in yearly average for the percentage
of loans to deposits of only 24.3%&mdash;the range being from 83% to
104%. <i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 325 and 331. For a partially different series of years,

trade may merely increase the activity of loans and deposits, causing both
to be shifted more rapidly&mdash;larger outgo, larger income, loans more frequently
contracted and paid off, larger amounts "deposited" on a given
day, but balances, both of loans and deposits, at the end of the day not
increased proportionately with the activity. This is strikingly illustrated
in the business of the stockbroker.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_350" id="Footnote_350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_350"><span class="label">[350]</span></a> A possible alternative interpretation of Professor Fisher's conception is
suggested in two or three sentences in the passage of the <i>Purchasing Power
of Money</i> I have been discussing. On p. 175 he makes a distinction between
individual prices <i>relatively to each other</i> and the price-level. But
the distinction which he <i>discusses</i> in the passage as a whole is between
the price-level and individual prices <i>not</i> considered in relation to each other.
Comparison, moreover, with his original enunciation of the notion (Papers
and Discussions, 23d Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association,
pp. 36-37), would serve to justify the interpretation I give, as nothing
at all is said there about super-ratios between individual prices. But the
internal evidence is even more convincing. Demand and supply, and cost
of production, find their problem, not in the relation between the money
price of aspirin and the money price of caviar, but in the money-price of
aspirin or the money-price of caviar considered separately. Professor Fisher
thus conceives supply and demand in his <i>Elementary Principles</i> (p. 260).
This interpretation is especially necessary, since Professor Fisher is joining
issue with writers who surely use demand and supply and cost of production
as means of explaining money-prices, and not super-ratios between
them. Further, the price-level is <i>not</i>, on Professor Fisher's own scheme, a
factor in determining the relations of the prices of sugar and of wheat <i>inter
se</i>. With a given price-level, wheat might be worth a dollar and sugar nine
cents, and the ratio of their money equivalents would be 100:9; with a price-level
twice as high, wheat would be worth two dollars, and sugar eighteen
cents, but the ratio between their money equivalents would be still 100:9.
The whole discussion is quite meaningless unless the contrast be between
concrete money-prices of particular goods, and their average. On either
interpretation, moreover, my criticism of the exalting of the average into
an entity would stand.</p></div>

Kemmerer in holding that this notion of Professor Fisher's is untenable.
"The distinction Professor Fisher draws between the prices of individual
commodities and the general price-level appears to me, as to Professor
Laughlin, to be untenable. It is, moreover, contradictory to his general
philosophy of money. His index numbers recognize no general price-level
distinct from individual prices.... Professor Fisher's illustration of
the ocean would be more apposite if he called it a lake whose level was
continually changing, and if he considered each particular wave as extending
to the bottom." Kemmerer, <i>Papers and Discussions</i>, 23d Annual Meeting
of the American Economic Association, p. 53. At the same time, I
agree with Professor Fisher that there must be something more fundamental
than the particular prices to make the scheme work. This something
I find in the absolute value of money.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_374" id="Footnote_374"></a><a href="#FNanchor_374"><span class="label">[374]</span></a> Various efforts have been made by adherents of the quantity theory
to meet the facts developed by Mitchell with reference to the Greenbacks.
Thus, it has been suggested that the coming to par of the Greenbacks shortly
before the resumption of specie payments was an accidental coincidence,
due to the fact that the volume of trade in the United States just happened
to grow to the right amount to bring the Greenbacks to par at that time.
No statistical evidence has been offered for this thesis, I believe. It is,
indeed, the only logical thing which a quantity theorist could say on the
matter, except one alternative, (F. R. Clow, <i>J. P. E.</i>, vol. II, p. 597) namely,
that if the Greenbacks should exist in such quantity that, under the quantity
theory, their value ought to fall below the discounted future value of
the gold in which they were to be redeemed, speculators would take them
out of circulation, holding them for the interest, and so reduce their quantity
that the value would rise to that discounted future value. The first
thesis, that based on putative changes in the volume of trade, though highly
improbable in fact, is logically possible. The second thesis, however (<i>Purchasing
Power of Money</i>, p. 261) meets serious difficulties. What motive
would a speculator have for taking the Greenbacks out of circulation, and
hoarding them? The answer is, he gets thereby the "interest," as the Greenbacks
approach the date for redemption in gold. If this were the only way
in which he could get this gain, the answer would be good. But there is
another way in which he can get it, and something more besides, namely,
by <i>lending out</i> his Greenbacks. In that case, since the creditor gets the full
benefit of an appreciating standard of deferred payments, he would get all
the "interest" which he could get by hoarding, and, in addition, he would
get contract interest on his loan. Of course, if the principle of "appreciation
and interest" worked out with perfect smoothness, he would find his
contract interest reduced as the other rose, and one might even expect, if
the Greenbacks were very redundant, that contract interest would disappear.
There is no evidence that this did happen, however! And so long
as any contract interest existed, we have a thoroughly valid reason why a
holder of Greenbacks would lend them rather than hoard them.
</p><p>
Another effort to harmonize the facts with the theory consists in the
contention that <i>anticipated</i> future increases in the Greenbacks would work
in the same way as actual increases. But this is to shift the whole basis of
the quantity theory, which rests in the notion of a mechanical and&mdash;in the
mass&mdash;unconscious equilibration of quantity of money and number of exchanges.
The quantity of money is not increased until it is increased! <i>Cf.</i>
Mill, <i>Principles</i>, Bk. III, ch. 12, par. 2, and Jos. F. Johnson, <i>Money and
Currency</i>, Rev. ed., p. 235.
</p><p>
Professor Fisher has another way to meet the facts of the Greenback
r&eacute;gime, and that is by holding that they prove his case! I do not think
that anyone, however, who examines the figures he offers on p. 260 (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
will be impressed by the degree of concomitance between money and prices
which they exhibit, especially after Mitchell's careful analysis of changes
in detail.
</p><p>
At another point, Professor Fisher maintains (p. 263) that the rapid
changes in gold premium which came with news from the military operations
(<i>e. g.</i>, the 4% drop in Greenbacks after Chickamauga), were due
to alterations in velocity of circulation and in volume of trade! As the
gold market usually got the news by wire, before the newspapers got it,
however, this thesis is not very convincing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_389" id="Footnote_389"></a><a href="#FNanchor_389"><span class="label">[389]</span></a> It is easier, sometimes, to make an assumption regarding a set of facts
than to find out what they are! In this case, some work was involved. Old
newspapers had to be hunted up for various cities, and letters had to be
written, to find out, for various cities, (a) clearings for March 17, 1909, and
(b) the number of banking days in the year 1909. This work was done
by Mr. N. J. Silberling, who got figures from 12 cities which had 69%
of all clearings outside New York. These cities are: Chicago, Philadelphia,
Boston, St. Louis, Pittsburg, San Francisco, Baltimore, New Orleans,
Atlanta, Providence, St. Paul, and Seattle. The daily average of clearings
for these cities in 1909 was $136,222,436; the actual clearings for March 17,
1909, was $132,961,273. The ratio of average daily clearings to actual
clearings on March 17 was 1.0245:1. The increase needed in the figure for
deposits outside New York, then, was only 2.45%. Mr. Silberling, wishing
to be conservative in view of the 31% of outside clearings not investigated,
allows outside clearings to be 3% below normal. On this
basis, following Professor Fisher's method of computation, he multiplies
the deposits assigned by Professor Fisher to New York by 1.28, and the
deposits assigned to the country outside by 1.03, getting total deposits
for the day of 1.11 billions, as against Professor Fisher's figure of 1.20 billions,
and a total for the year of 333 billions, as against a total obtained by
Professor Fisher of 364 billions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_390" id="Footnote_390"></a><a href="#FNanchor_390"><span class="label">[390]</span></a> To this 786 millions is added all that comes from the erroneous assumption
regarding outside clearings, when figures for the whole year are obtained.
Country deposits, for the year, are thus still further exaggerated
by 31 billions!</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_391" id="Footnote_391"></a><a href="#FNanchor_391"><span class="label">[391]</span></a> <i>The Use of Credit Instruments</i>, etc., p. 152. There is abundant evidence
in Dean Kinley's figures that only a decidedly minor part of the amount
(373 millions) of checks allowed by Professor Weston for the non-reporting
banks could have been outside the larger cities. The amount deposited
in a day in a country bank is so small that a great multitude of these banks
would be required to show as much as a single New York City institution.
Thus, ninety banks (27 national banks, 58 State banks, 3 private banks,
1 stock savings bank, 1 trust company) in Arkansas, report only $728,148
in checks, an average of $8,090 per bank. If all the 13,000 non-reporting
banks were country banks, and if this ratio held, we should have 105 millions
more for the day (instead of Professor Weston's 373 millions), or 31
billions more for the year. This average is based chiefly on State and
national banks. The average is too high for the private banks (whose daily
average as reported is $4,010), and for the mutual savings banks (whose
daily average is $1,254). It is well above the daily average of the stock
savings banks, which are, in many States, practically commercial banks
($6,405). In the non-reporting banks there are comparatively few national
banks, and about 5,000 private banks and savings banks, of these the great
majority being private banks. We cannot make up the 373 millions in the
country districts. Nor can we make up the 373 millions by taking in all
the reserve and central reserve cities, exclusive of New York. Chicago,
in the returns, shows 42.6 millions in checks; St. Louis, 14 millions; Boston,
48.8 millions; Philadelphia, 28.6 millions; the other reserve cities show 40.2
millions&mdash;a total of 174 millions. If we doubled the returns for these cities,
we should still be 200 millions short of the 373 millions added by Professor
Weston to the total! Neither in the country districts, nor in the major
cities outside New York can we find enough to make up that addition. Very
much of the amount added for non-reporting banks must be found in New
York City itself.</p></div>

Banks and Trust Companies</i>. Professor Barnett writes, in part, as follows:
"I made no independent inquiry at the time, and accepted the statement
of the superintendent of banks without critical examination of its basis.
From what you say, it appears highly probable that he was mistaken in his
conclusions. The only question in which I was interested was whether the
reserves of the trust companies could be reasonably lower than those of the
national banks. I did not care so much about the exact ratio of clearings
and only quoted that incidentally." For the purposes which both Professor
Barnett and Mr. Williams had in view, the exact ratio was unimportant.
The higher figures which I have given above would support the thesis in
which both were interested, namely, that trust company accounts are less
active than bank accounts, and so lower reserves may be safely held by
trust companies than by national banks.</p></div>

New York State. Kinley's figures show that the percentage of checks received
in deposits of March 16, 1909, in banks outside New York State was
91%. <i>Loc. cit.</i>, p. 180.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_402" id="Footnote_402"></a><a href="#FNanchor_402"><span class="label">[402]</span></a> Multiplying the 408 millions of checks deposited outside New York on
March 16, 1909 by 303, the assumed number of banking days, gives 123.6
billions. Probably, therefore, 124 billions is too small a figure. But we
should be slow in modifying a figure based on 17 months' observations because
of the figures from one day's observations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_403" id="Footnote_403"></a><a href="#FNanchor_403"><span class="label">[403]</span></a> I have greater confidence in this conclusion, since seeing a letter from
Mr. Howard Wolfe, who made the investigation of outside clearings and
"total transactions" for the American Bankers' Association, to Mr. Osmund
Phillips, Editor of the <i>Annalist</i>. Mr. Wolfe writes: "I do not believe that
the experience of the New York banks would differ from that of other institutions
which now supply [these figures]."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_404" id="Footnote_404"></a><a href="#FNanchor_404"><span class="label">[404]</span></a> My information on this point comes from Professor O. M. W. Sprague.

of Collecting Transit Items," <i>Journal of the American Bankers' Association</i>,
Jan. 1914, p. 537. Boston inaugurated the system in 1890-1900;
Kansas City five years later. Since the above was written, I have learned
that New York, in recent months, has introduced the new system. This
does not affect our argument regarding the figures for 1909.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_406" id="Footnote_406"></a><a href="#FNanchor_406"><span class="label">[406]</span></a> Since the foregoing was written, my attention has been called by Mr.
Osmund Phillips, Financial Editor of the New York <i>Times</i>, and Editor of
the <i>Annalist</i>, to indirect ways in which items on out of town banks sent to
New York for collection will affect New York clearings. Country correspondent
banks to which New York banks send these items for collection,
may remit for them in four ways: (1) by sending cash; (2) by sending items
on out-of-town banks, which the New York bank will send on to some other
correspondent for collection; (3) by draft on the New York bank which
has sent the items to be collected; (4) by draft on some other New York
bank. In the last case, New York clearings are affected. The first case is
not, quantitatively, important. The second and third cases would seem
to be the normal types, assuming correspondent relations between New York
banks and country banks to be <i>reciprocal</i>, since the New York bank would
be disposed, as far as possible, to turn over its collection business to its own
depositors among the country banks. Mr. Phillips says, however, that the
fourth case is important. To the extent that this is true, our conclusion
that out of town collection items do not affect New York clearings must be
modified, and it becomes a matter of importance whether these items are
large or small. My information, as stated above, is that Chicago exceeds
New York City in this.
</p><p>
If, however, the Kansas City and Boston arrangements held in New York,
these collection items would be represented <i>twice</i> in New York clearings.
The fact that the items do not themselves get into the clearings remains.
</p><p>
Direct information regarding New York clearings is very desirable. Our
indirect approach must be considered inconclusive until more detailed figures
for New York City are at hand. We need figures covering all types
of banks in New York, for a period of, say, a year (to allow for seasonal
changes), in which deposits made by one bank in another are separated
from other deposits. National banks alone would exaggerate the item of
deposits by one bank in another, especially as they are the depositories of
the great private banks.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_407" id="Footnote_407"></a><a href="#FNanchor_407"><span class="label">[407]</span></a> Or, in some cases, taking the place of cash dealings between banks and a
local clearing house. On the face of it, it is incredible that <i>balances</i> between
cities, or <i>within</i> cities, after the country clearing houses have done their
work, should be so great as to account for a very great part of New York
clearings. These balances between cities other than New York, and balances
within country clearing houses, must be a minor fraction of <i>country</i>
clearings, and country clearings are little more than half of New York
clearings. Ordinary commerce, as shown in chapter XIII, cannot give rise
to great sums in the aggregate, to say nothing of giving rise to great <i>balances</i>.</p></div>

following information: data for twenty banks, six in New York and fourteen
in Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, and St. Louis, for the week, Aug. 28-Sept.
2, 1916, show that clearings are 71% of "total transactions" in New
York, and about 40% in the other cities. These figures are all for national
banks, except for one bank in St. Louis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_411" id="Footnote_411"></a><a href="#FNanchor_411"><span class="label">[411]</span></a> There is one further generalization developed in connection with Mr.
Wolfe's investigation of the ratio of clearings to "total transactions" which
seems to have relevance here, though I am not sure how it should be interpreted.
The average ratio, as stated, is about 40%. This varies,
however, for different cities. "The rule seems to be that the larger the
proportion of bank deposits to individual deposits, the smaller will be the
figure representing this ratio. In Cincinnati, for example, it is 31.4%
while in Los Angeles it is 59.7%." (<i>Jour. of American Bankers' Ass'n</i>,
Jan. 1914, p. 487.) How safely based this generalization is cannot be
told from the context, as no further facts are offered. Nor is its bearing
on the question at issue, as to whether or not New York clearings bear a
higher ratio to New York deposits than country clearings do to country
deposits, entirely clear. It would seem to indicate that deposits made by
outside bankers in the banks of reserve cities make smaller contributions
to clearings than individual deposits do, and this would fit in with the fact
that checks on outside banks, deposited for collection by one bank in another,
do not get into clearings. What further explanation or significance it has
I leave to the reader. It is possible that there are a number of important
relevant facts missing regarding New York clearings, and that the conclusions
here reached may require later revision.</p></div>

of T, <i>infra</i>, that MV (and hence V), assuming the calculation otherwise

more complexities, into which we shall not enter, as the absolute amount
is small&mdash;only 34 billions!&mdash;and the possible error from this source not great
enough to affect a calculation where 20 billions one way or the other is
within the "margin of error."</p></div>

I am in hearty agreement! The overcounting is worse in Kemmerer's figures

made by one bank in another, while the 1909 figures do not. <i>Cf.</i>

Kinley (<i>The Use of Credit Instruments</i>, p. 151), as holding that duplications
have largely been eliminated from his 1909 figures. Professor Fisher overlooks
the fact that Dean Kinley is here referring, not to money value of
trade, but merely to volume of checks. Dean Kinley merely indicates that
by eliminating deposits made by one bank in another, he has avoided having
the same check counted in deposits made in two or more banks on the same
day. Even this is not wholly avoided. (<i>Ibid.</i>, pp. 158-159.) It was extensive
in the 1896 figures. Dean Kinley thinks, properly enough, that he has a
sufficiently close approximation to the volume of checks, for the reporting
banks, but what the checks were drawn for he does not undertake to say.
His problem was <i>payments</i>, not <i>trade</i>. From the angle of volume of trade,
he finds duplications even in the retail deposits (<i>Jour. of Polit. Econ.</i>, vol. 5,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_439" id="Footnote_439"></a><a href="#FNanchor_439"><span class="label">[439]</span></a> One factor complicates this. Are all the hundred share sales recorded?
In our chapter on "Volume of Money and Volume of Trade," we called
attention to a statement to the effect that brokers get together before the
market opens, and compare "stop loss" orders, matching these with other
orders, with the understanding that they automatically go into effect if
the "market" reaches the prices indicated. The statement indicated that
this substantially increases sales beyond the recorded totals, as such sales
do not get on the ticker. I think, however, that this cannot throw our
reckoning out greatly. The great majority of sales are not on "stop loss"
orders. None of the sales of "floor traders," who average a third of the
total trading (<i>Pujo Committee Report</i>, Feb. 28, 1913, p. 45), would be on
"stop loss" orders. The bulk of the rest is not. Moreover, not all stop loss
orders, by any means, would be executed in this manner. It is not easy to
see how, under the rules and practices of the Exchange, many other sales
could go unrecorded, except on days of greatest stress. On September 25,
1916, when over 2,300,000 shares were sold, the daily paper spoke of sales
missed by the ticker, which was swamped with sales to be recorded, as an
item of some magnitude. But the Ticker is wonderfully efficient. It sometimes
gets behind the market by several minutes, but it rarely misses anything,
under ordinary conditions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_447" id="Footnote_447"></a><a href="#FNanchor_447"><span class="label">[447]</span></a> There is one further piece of evidence which has been obtained through
the courtesy of a New York brokerage house. At the request of the gentleman
who has supplied the figures, I have altered them by a constant percentage,
to prevent possible identification, but the proportions among them
hold as they were given. The figures show the business of the house for
the month of March, 1916. The figures show:
</p>
<p>
Market value of stocks and bonds bought,  1,644,630<br />
Total deposits made during month,         1,475,502<br />
Average borrowed from banks,                952,000<br />
</p>
<p>
For this house, then, for this month, the deposits were less than the
value of securities sold, by 11.5%. The month, however, was unusual.
It was a month of reduced activity, following large activity. This is strikingly
shown by the figure for the <i>average</i> bank loans for the month&mdash;over
two-thirds of the <i>total</i> deposits for the month. The house had a large bull
<i>client&egrave;le</i>, which was holding its stocks, and not selling on a bear market.
The turnover was very slow, as Wall Street goes. It was a time of extraordinarily
easy money when banks called few if any loans. The broker, in
explanation of his figures, says: "The most of our checks were to other
brokers. Checks to banks about equaled checks to customers. Your assumption
that we did not pay off many loans in March is, I think, right."
The same broker states in another letter that he thinks that, in general,
the bulk of checks to and from brokers are in dealings with banks. In this
month, then, with this factor reduced to a minimum, we still have deposits
undercounting sales by only 11.5%. The figures do not prove my
thesis that brokers' deposits greatly overcount their sales, but they at least
show that they do not greatly undercount them. In view of the peculiarities
of the month chosen, with transactions between banks and brokers cut to
the minimum, they are quite consistent with the contention that normally
the brokers' deposits will much exceed their sales.</p></div>

with money in payments as a "sure minimum" for 1896, but rather
counts it as a "fair maximum." (<i>Loc. cit.</i>, p. 106.) Using this as a basis,
he gets a monetary circulation for 1896 of 47.7 billions, and a "velocity of

1 billion) of 47. (<i>Loc. cit.</i>, p. 114.) Kinley's fuller investigation in 1909 has
made it clear that his 1896 conclusions understated, rather than overstated,
the proportion of checks to money. His "sure minimum" was needlessly
low. He concludes in 1909 that 80 to 85% for checks is safe. (<i>Op.
cit.</i>, p. 201.) <i>Cf.</i> Fisher's comments, <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 430; 460 <i>et seq.</i> Fisher's V

the better estimate here.</p></div>

value and exchangeability, since Mr. Horace White, in his <i>Money and Banking</i>
(5th ed., p. 135), identifies value and exchangeability: "Value is an
ideal thing in the same sense that weight is. The former means exchangeability;
the latter means force of gravity. A dollar is a definite amount of
exchangeability." <i>Cf.</i> also Amasa Walker's contention that "exchangeable
value" is tautology, equivalent to "exchangeable exchangeability!" <i>Science
of Wealth</i>, 5th ed., p. 9. <i>Cf.</i> my article "The Concept of Value Further

Journal of Economics</i>, Aug. 1915, p. 704. It is due Menger to point out that
he does not make the distinction between value and exchangeability which I
have just made. His theory rests in an analysis of the saleability or exchangeability
of goods. But Menger's conception of value is essentially different
from my own. He commonly means by "<i>Wert</i>" merely subjective value, or
marginal utility. He objects to the notion that one good measures the value
of another, or that goods, when exchanged, are equivalent in value, on the
ground that there must be a surplus in value (subjective value) for each exchanger,
or exchange would not take place. He has, as a primary concept, no
absolute social value. "<i>Tauschwert</i>" is for him a relative value, though he is
finally driven to constructing what is virtually an absolute value notion, by
distinguishing "<i>&auml;usserer Tauschwert</i>" from "<i>innerer Tauschwert</i>" in the case
of money, the latter being concerned exclusively with the causes affecting
prices <i>from the side</i> of money, ignoring changes in prices due to causes affecting
goods. (<i>Cf.</i> art. "Geld," in <i>Handw&ouml;rterbuch der Staatswissenschaften</i>,
3d ed., pp. 592-593. He does not make this distinction in developing the
theory of saleability of goods, however. <i>Cf.</i> the chapter, <i>supra</i>, on "Marginal
Utility and the Value of Money." It is absolute social value which
I am here distinguishing from exchangeability. It is equally true, however,
that subjective value and exchangeability have no necessary correlation.)</p></div>

of the statistics of the precious metals to justify any statistical conclusions
regarding the laws governing the industrial consumption of gold
and silver. Even the facts as to the proportions of annual production of
gold in recent years going to money and to the arts are in dispute. Thus,
DeLaunay (<i>The World's Gold</i>, New York, 1908, p. 176), divides the annual
output as follows: Exportation to the East, and loss, 16%; coinage, 44%; industry,
40%. The industrial employments are divided as follows: jewelry,
24% (of total annual gold production); watch cases, 10%; gold leaf, 2.25%;
watch chains, 1.75%; plate, 0.75%; various uses, as pens, dentistry, chemical
works, etc., 1.25%. DeLaunay's competence as an authority is attested by
various writers, among them W. C. Mitchell (<i>Business Cycles</i>, p. 281).
Mitchell, comparing DeLaunay's estimates with divergent estimates of other
authorities, concludes that there is not sufficient evidence to justify definite
conclusions. I do not think that anyone who has read the criticisms which
Touzet has brought together (<i>Emplois Industriels des M&eacute;taux Pr&eacute;cieux</i>,
Paris, 1911, pp. 49-52) of the methods employed in the investigations by
the Director of the United States Mint in 1879, 1881, 1884, 1886, and 1900,
will have large confidence in the exactness of the results reached in those
investigations. (See annual reports of the Director of the Mint for the
years in question.) Touzet's careful and elaborate study employs the figures
of these investigations as the best available, but with substantial misgivings.
There are many indeterminate elements in the problem, as shown by both
Touzet and DeLaunay, among them, the extent to which coin is melted
down for industrial purposes.
</p><p>
The Director of the Mint would assign a much higher proportion of the
annual output to coinage than would DeLaunay.
</p><p>
Earlier studies, by Soetbeer and Suess, seem quite out of harmony with
these conclusions. (Suess, Eduard, <i>The Future of Silver</i>, Washington,
Government Printing Office, 1893, pp. 51-53.) Suess thinks that virtually
as much gold was going into the arts uses as was being produced, in 1892,
and quotes Soetbeer (<i>Litteraturnachweis</i>, p. 285) as admitting that such a
contention may not be demonstrable, but at the same time holding that it
cannot be disproved.
</p><p>
In the face of what seems to be a really indeterminate statistical problem,
I content myself with the theoretical conclusions in the text. Because I
cannot find adequate grounds for confidence in the main source from which
he has drawn his statistics, I refrain from a criticism of the theory and method
underlying Professor J. M. Clark's ingenious effort to derive statistical laws
for the elasticity of the arts demand for gold. (<i>American Economic Review</i>,
Sept. 1913.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_486" id="Footnote_486"></a><a href="#FNanchor_486"><span class="label">[486]</span></a> Leipzig, 1905. This book has had wide influence on German thinking
on money. It is typical of the tendency in German thought to make the
State the centre of everything. Recognizing the historical fact that money
has originated in a commodity, it holds that the commodity basis is a phenomenon
of historical significance only, that modern money is a creature
of the State. The money-unit is not definable as a quantity of metal, of
given fineness, but rather is a "nominal" thing, present monetary standards
being defined by legal proclamation in terms of past standards. The necessity
for this reference to past standards grows out of the existence of past
<i>debts</i>. The State must preserve the continuity of juristic relations, between
debtors and creditors as elsewhere. Knapp holds that the <i>Zahlungsmittel</i>
(legal means of quittance, legal tender) function is the primary function of
money, and that it is not a concept subordinate to <i>Tauschmittel</i> (medium
of exchange). It is not necessary for our purposes to take account of Knapp's
theory in detail. He really has little to say about the value of money. Indeed,
he confesses, in a later discussion, that his theory is not concerned
with that subject! (<i>Schriften des Vereins f&uuml;r Sozialpolitik</i>, No. 132, 1909,
pp. 559-563.) The amount of economic analysis in the book is not great.
It is a striking illustration of the fact that legal thinking is largely concerned
with <i>qualitative distinctions</i>, rather than with quantitative causal
conceptions. (<i>Cf.</i> my discussion in the chapter on "The Reconciliation of
Statics and Dynamics," <i>infra</i>, of the "statics" of the law.) Knapp's book
has a forbidding appearance, because of the large number of new terms,
based on Greek roots, which he has coined. The German language is inadequate
to express his ideas! The Germans themselves have complained
much of this. Careful reading of the book discloses, however, that the new
terms are admirably adapted to express the distinctions he draws. I think,
too, that English readers of the book, who remember enough of their Greek
to recognize an occasional Greek root as vaguely familiar, will find less
difficulty in giving fixed meanings to his new terms than would be the case
with new German compounds. One who takes the trouble to master Knapp's
vocabulary will find the effort worth while. Knapp has a high order of
dialectical acumen. But the main part of the book has little direct bearing
on the problem of the value of money, whether one understand by "value
of money" the absolute social value of money, or the reciprocal of the price-level.
The main points to be drawn from his discussion are (1) the fact
that past debts may tend to sustain the value of an otherwise worthless
money; and (2) that the State's willingness to accept money for taxes, etc.,
may also contribute to its value. Knapp lays heaviest stress on this last
point. He seems to concede, however, that the r&ocirc;le of the State here is not
different from that of any other big factor in the market, and that the State's
power in this particular is a function of the magnitude of its fiscal operations.
Both of these doctrines fit readily into my social value theory. Knapp's
discussion of methods of regulating the international exchanges by methods
other than gold shipments is interesting, and might well be studied by those
who are concerned with the exchange situation in the present war. His
thesis that the value of silver depended on the course of the exchanges between
gold and silver countries, instead of the course of the exchanges
depending on the values of gold and silver, seems to me an absurd exaggeration
of a minor qualification into a main theory. His doctrine that international
relations alone make the purely legal money, without commodity
basis, unsatisfactory, I do not accept. I have discussed this general topic
in my chapter on "Dodo-Bones," however, and may content myself with
now referring to that chapter. It is not true, as a matter of fact, moreover,
that the money-unit is no longer defined as a quantity of metal. Our own
American practice is sufficient evidence on this point. Knapp has sought
to generalize his own interpretation of the history of Austrian paper into
universal laws of money! That his interpretations meet authoritative dissent
in Austria is sufficiently evidenced by von Mises' discussion, in his <i>Theorie
des Geldes</i> (ch. on "Das Geld und der Staat"), and in his English article
on "The Foreign Exchange Policy of the Austro-Hungarian Bank," British
<i>Economic Journal</i>, 1909. The notion that the legal tender function is prior
to the medium of exchange function I regard as quite indefensible. It is
doubtless true, in certain cases, that a government may debase its money,
defining the new debased money in terms of the old, and that people who
have debts to pay may, for a time, accept the debased money as a medium
of exchange. But the limit of this is reached when the old debts have been
paid. Unless other factors (not necessarily redemption), then come in to
sustain the value, the value will sink, to a level commensurate with the
debasement. The value would generally sink to a considerable degree, in
any case, if only the legal factors worked to sustain it. I have gone over
this in the chapter on "Dodo-Bones," <i>supra</i>. It was only by being a valuable
object, and commonly only by being a medium of exchange, that the money
could have become a means of legal quittance in the first place. Men would
not have made contracts in terms of it, otherwise. And men would cease
making contracts in it as soon as it (or other things tied to it in value) ceased
to be an acceptable medium of exchange.
</p><p>
Knapp finds a good many phenomena in the history of money for which
the quantity theory, and the metallist theory, can give no explanation. He
has an exceedingly poor opinion of both theories, and makes many telling
points against both. In so far as his doctrine asserts that the phenomena
of money are matters of social organization, psychological in nature, I find
myself in harmony with it. My dissent comes when he seeks to erect the
abstractions of the jurist into a complete social philosophy! Law is only a
part of the system of social control, and economic values, while influenced
by legal values, are far from being explained when legal factors only are
taken into account. Legal factors often play a more direct part in connection
with the value of money than in connection with other values, but
they do not dominate the value of money.
</p><p>
Recent German literature on money (<i>e. g.</i>, Fr. Bendixsen, <i>Geld und Kapital</i>,
Leipzig, 1912) has been a good deal influenced by Knapp, and there is
a fair chance that American students may have to read his book if they
wish to understand the next decade of German monetary history. It will
be well for Germany if this is not the case!</p></div>

thorough study of the course of the gold premium on the Rupee, the agio
of the Rupee over its bullion content, or the course of prices in India, during
the period from 1893 to 1898, to justify confident statements as to the comparative
strength of different elements in the explanation of that history.
Kemmerer states (<i>Money and Credit Instruments</i>, p. 38) that he can find no
evidence at all to support Laughlin's view of the matter. (See Laughlin,
<i>Principles of Money</i>, pp. 524 et seq.) J. M. Keynes, however, in his <i>Indian
Currency and Finance</i>, p. 5, says: "The Committee of 1892 did not commit
themselves; but the system which their recommendations established was
<i>generally supposed</i> [Italics mine.] to be transitional and a first step toward
the <i>introduction of gold</i> [italics mine.]." In the arrangements of 1893,
moreover, a ratio between English gold and the Rupee was established, of
16d. to the Rupee, even though provisions for holding the Rupee to this
ratio were left till the establishment of the "gold exchange standard,"
several years later. Keynes, on p. 3, discusses the arguments of the
silver party against the introduction of gold, which is further evidence
that the action of the Committee was understood as looking toward a gold
standard. There is <i>some</i> evidence at least for Laughlin's view. That his
view offers a complete explanation, I think unlikely.
</p><p>
Kemmerer's admirable <i>Modern Currency Reforms</i> (Macmillan, 1916), is
at hand while the proof sheets are being revised. It is interesting to note
that he finds the statistical evidence regarding Indian prices, trade, etc.,
far too scanty to justify positive conclusions as to the causes governing the

the new bank-credit, without the painful <i>preliminary</i> "abstinence" which
the classical economics has stressed, is enough to provide capital for a new
enterprise is, as Schumpeter insists, true. Schumpeter has made an important
contribution in his emphasis on this too much neglected point. But
it should be noted that this does not dispense with curtailing of consumption,
and "abstinence." It merely shifts the necessity for curtailing consumption
to some one else. The new plan of the dynamic entrepreneur, by
means of bank credit, draws labor and capital away from the existing static
enterprises. That curtails their output. That leaves less goods of the old
kinds for people to consume. That means higher prices for consumption
goods, in the interval between the starting of the new enterprise and the
time when its finished products are added to the "real income" of the community.
Extensions of bank credit, there, shift the burden of "abstinence"
to the consumer, and to the static producer. "Saving" is still the source of
capital, but it is involuntary saving.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_528" id="Footnote_528"></a><a href="#FNanchor_528"><span class="label">[528]</span></a> A single observation does not justify very confident conclusions, and
figures for subsequent years may alter this. There is reason for supposing
that commodity collateral was unusually large in proportion in the Comptroller's
figures for national banks in June, 1915, (1) because the banks had
been trying to reduce stock collateral loans, following the collapse of the
outbreak of the War, (2) because they were aiding cotton owners to tide
over a period of stress, and (3) because of great grain speculation. Later:
1916 figures show this. Comptroller's <i>Report</i>, I, p. 30. Stock loans increase
from 66% to 71.2%, of collateral loans.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_529" id="Footnote_529"></a><a href="#FNanchor_529"><span class="label">[529]</span></a> The preceding argument would indicate that it is much too high.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_530" id="Footnote_530"></a><a href="#FNanchor_530"><span class="label">[530]</span></a> The figures for 1909 are fairly typical of the proportions of these items
in the assets of the three classes of institutions for the ten years from 1904
to 1914. Since 1900, there has been some increase in the percentages of
real estate loans and "all other loans," at the expense of the percentage of
securities owned, and collateral loans, as these years have been years of
reduced activity on the Stock Exchange. The changes are not important
enough, however, to modify any conclusions which we shall base on the
figures here given. All classes of loans have grown, and investments in
securities have grown, but real estate loans and "all other loans," particularly
the latter, have grown somewhat more rapidly.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_531" id="Footnote_531"></a><a href="#FNanchor_531"><span class="label">[531]</span></a> These figures are taken from Conant, <i>Principles of Money and Banking</i>,

is the <i>Comptroller's Report</i> for 1904 and preceding years), doubtless includes
a good many items which we have decided not to count as commercial paper.
The item, "advances on securities," also includes some items other
than stock exchange loans, but not a high percentage in New York City.
In 1913 the figures for all reporting banks in New York City were: collateral
loans, 1,070; "other loans," 658. <i>Report of Comptroller</i>, 1913, p. 779.</p></div>

for "commercial paper" may well be questioned, since our conception of
commercial liquid loans would include manufacturers' paper which represents
raw materials, work in process, and bills receivable. However, we
have found reason to conclude that Kinley's wholesale deposits include a
large percentage of manufacturers' deposits. (<i>Supra</i>, p. 245.) The comparison
here is in any case rough. We do not need precise figures for the
argument.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_537" id="Footnote_537"></a><a href="#FNanchor_537"><span class="label">[537]</span></a> Pratt, <i>Work of Wall Street</i>, 1912 ed., p. 264.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_538" id="Footnote_538"></a><a href="#FNanchor_538"><span class="label">[538]</span></a> Returns from private banks in Kinley's investigation of 1909 are virtually
negligible, so far as absolute amounts are concerned, for the whole
country. For New York City, they are absolutely negligible. The "all
other deposits" reported by private banks in New York City for March 16,
1909, are one thousand, nine hundred and eighty-four dollars, in all! The
grand total, "all other deposits" for all classes of banks reporting in New
York, is over a hundred and ninety-eight millions. The great private banks
are, thus, clearly not represented. They are not represented in any form,
since Kinley's figures exclude deposits made by such banks in other banks.
How important they would be, if included, one cannot be sure, since they
keep their affairs pretty secret. Some information, however, is available.
Thus, the Pujo Committee reports (<i>Report</i>, Feb. 28, 1913, p. 145) that on
Nov. 1, 1912, there was $114,000,000 on deposit with J. P. Morgan and
Company, exclusive of $49,000,000 on deposit with their Philadelphia
branch of Drexel and Co. It is understood to be the practice of J. P. Morgan
and Co. to keep no cash on hand, and to deposit with other banks all their
cash and checks. On this date, they had on deposit with other banks
$12,094,000, "which presumably included all their own funds." It may
be assumed, therefore, that the remaining 102 millions was loaned out.
There can be no doubt at all, I suppose, that practically all they had
lent out was on stock and bond collateral. They are known to be one of
the biggest lenders at the "money post" on the Stock Exchange. They
are not supposed to do much business with ordinary merchants in the usual
discount and deposit way.
</p><p>
I have found no figures for Kuhn-Loeb &amp; Co., for total deposits made
with them, nor for their deposits in other banks. The Pujo Committee
(<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 73) states that for the six years preceding 1913 this firm held,
on the average, deposits from interstate corporations amounting to over
17 millions. For J. P. Morgan &amp; Co., this class of deposits amounted to
about half of total deposits. (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 57.) There is, of course, no assurance
that this proportion holds with Kuhn-Loeb's deposits.
</p><p>
These figures are very great, however. For the week ending April 3,
1915, for example, only three banks (the National City Bank, the National
Bank of Commerce, and the Chase National Bank), and only two trust
companies (the Bankers Trust Company and the Guarantee Trust Company),
held deposits exceeding those credited to J. P. Morgan and Co.,
and only one of these, the National City Bank, very markedly exceeded
the Morgan deposits. The majority of the New York Clearing House banks
had less than the deposits of interstate corporations with Kuhn-Loeb.
</p><p>
As all the big private bankers deal chiefly in stock exchange loans and
securities, and foreign exchange, and as this kind of business has been shown
to be exceedingly active and to call for large checks and clearings, we may
assume that Kinley's figures would be greatly increased if they were included.
</p><p>
The trust company reports for New York in Kinley's figures are also
very incomplete. New York trust companies report less than twice as
much as Boston trust companies, and an absurdly small amount as compared
with banks. <i>Cf.</i>, <i>supra</i>, the chapter on "Statistical Demonstrations
of the Quantity Theory."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_539" id="Footnote_539"></a><a href="#FNanchor_539"><span class="label">[539]</span></a> It has been supposed by many writers that New York clearings exaggerate

that this is not true to a sufficient degree to modify the present argument.

collateral.</p></div>

escapes much of this criticism. <i>Supra</i>, chapter on "Equation of Exchange."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_546" id="Footnote_546"></a><a href="#FNanchor_546"><span class="label">[546]</span></a> It is nothing for Wall Street to "turn over" many times two billion
dollars worth of securities. In a big bull year, this will be accomplished
twelve or more times without effort&mdash;prices rising merrily, so long as no new
supply of stocks and bonds comes in to make trouble. (See our estimate
of New York security transactions, <i>supra</i>, chapter on "Volume of Money
and Volume of Trade.") But let there be a liquidation by investors of anything
like two billions, sold once, and the market feels a tremendous drag.
It seems universally agreed that foreign selling of securities during the
present War has been a great factor in checking advances in security prices
in New York. The actual amount of liquidating by foreign investors, however,
has been trifling as compared with the volume of sales since the War
began. The best estimate of foreign liquidation is probably that of the
National City Bank, which has taken careful account of previous estimates,
and which has unrivaled sources of "inside information." The estimate
of this institution is that from a billion and a half to a billion six hundred
million dollars worth of foreign held securities have been liquidated in
America since the beginning of the War. (This does not include foreign
loans placed here.) This estimate is given in October of 1916. (Monthly
circular of the National City Bank on "Economic Conditions, etc.," Oct.,
1916, p. 3.) It is safe to say that no amount of "churning" of securities
already in the market could have anything like the depressing effect on
security prices that an unusual amount of liquidation by investors has.
It is not increase in number of <i>exchanges</i> that depresses prices. It is increase
in the floating <i>supply</i>. Activity in the floating supply makes it easier,
rather than harder, for speculators to get banking accommodations which
enable them to "hold" and "carry" securities, and activity in sales therefore
positively tends to <i>increase</i> rather than to decrease, security prices.
The broadening of the range of securities dealt in, moreover, instead of
depressing the prices of those already active, helps to sustain them. Thus,
brokers and bankers welcomed the recent revival of activity in the rails,
following the bull market in war stocks. It gave a broader basis for loans.
Banks would lend more liberally, and on narrower margins, if railroad
stocks could be mixed with the brokers' war stock collateral.
</p><p>
Here again we see the significance of the distinction between long-time
interest rates, connected with the volume of real capital, and the "money-rates."
</p><p>
Again, periodic payments of interest and dividends, temporarily locking
up considerable sums of bank deposits which have to be built up in anticipation of such payments, have a very much more serious effect on the money
market than do payments many times greater in connection with stock
sales. The tension in the London money market growing out of periodic
accumulations and disbursements of the British Government is well known.
The summer of 1916 witnessed a temporary tightening in Wall Street (in
what was, generally, the period of easiest money the Street has ever known),
from a similar cause&mdash;a bunching of dividend and interest payments, with
some other large financial transactions. Money rates in New York regularly
show the influence of such payments, temporarily. Money rates
also show the influence of active speculation, as a rule, as shown by Mr.
Silberling's investigations ("The Mystery of Clearings," <i>Annalist</i>, Aug. 14,

The doctrines criticised in my article were static theories, and my criticisms
made the static assumptions. Professor Haig, accepting the validity of
my criticisms on the assumptions laid down, for the most part, seeks to
recast the argument on a dynamic basis, emphasizing dynamic and "frictional"
considerations from which my argument had abstracted. I think
that what difference of opinion remains between us would probably be
removed if the distinction between static and dynamic were clearly drawn
and rigidly adhered to.</p></div>

theory is essentially "static" will appear strikingly if the statements in

Power of Money</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_585" id="Footnote_585"></a><a href="#FNanchor_585"><span class="label">[585]</span></a> It is only as a matter of highly abstract statics that the capitalization
theory (as presented in earlier chapters) can be maintained with any strictness.
In fact, capital values are not always passive shadows, yielding freely
to changes in anticipated income, and to changes in the rate of discount.
Very often capital values become themselves substantial, become divorced
from their presuppositions, can no longer be explained by any imputation
process. This is particularly likely to be the case with lands in inactive
markets. The income-bearer is as much an object of value as is the income;
is often <i>immediately</i>, for its own sake, an object of value. The long-run
tendency to assimilate this value to a capitalization of prospective incomes
may be exceedingly slow in working out, if it ever works out. Indeed, a
high capital value may sometimes be a means of increasing the income,
since in the minds both of lessor and lessee the usual percentage return on
capital will be a factor in determining what is a "proper" rental. If a capital
value, no longer justified by prospective income, has behind it the sanction
of actual cost-outlay, there may easily be a reflex from it on the size
of the income itself. Such a capital value, unjustified by prospective income,
but still believed in by the market, may function just as effectively
as any other capital value. Book-values, not marked down to correspond
with changed income-prospects, even when they cannot command purchasers,
may still serve as a basis for <i>loans</i>&mdash;Veblen's theory of crises rests,
as we shall see, in part on this fact.
</p><p>
Considerations of this sort strengthen still further the case against the
marginal utility theory of value. To pass,&mdash;as Fetter and the Austrians
in general seek to do&mdash;from marginal individual consumption values to
market prices of consumption goods, then to prices of production goods,
or to magnitudes of distributive shares, then, simply, by the capitalization
theory, to capital values, with the notion that the original marginal utilities
supply the psychological explanation at every stage of the process, the remoter
values being merely built up of the original marginal utilities, is
quite invalid. At every stage there is a hitch: the marginal utilities do not
explain the prices or values of the consumption goods, as has already been
elaborately pointed out; and the relation between the values of consumption
goods and the capital values is very much looser and less direct than
the static theory requires. Institutional, legal, and moral forces come in,
not alone at the first step, in giving social weight to the wants of special
classes and individuals, but also at the second, giving prestige to certain
enterprises, and so higher values to their securities, giving banking support
here and refusing it there, giving popular and patriotic support here, and
not there, giving direct action of law, custom and tradition on certain <i>prices</i>
(whence, indirectly on values), and leaving prices free to change readily in
other cases. (<i>Cf.</i> my discussion in <i>Quart. Jour, of Economics</i>, Aug. 1915,
pp. 699-701.) The static theory of capitalization describes an ideal logical
relation, while capital values are, in fact, built up by a psychological process
which is logical only in part. In large degree, especially when the market
lacks perfect fluidity, capital values are <i>immediate</i>, and not merely <i>derived</i>,
values. In this, I think, I am in accord with the view briefly stated by A. S.
Johnson in his recent review of B&ouml;hm-Bawerk (<i>Am. Econ. Rev.</i>, March,
1914, pp. 115-116).</p></div>

From Oct. 1915, to Aug. 1916, the "bears" dominated the market, and
prices fell pretty steadily. The "bull" movement of Sept. 1916, seems to
have reached its crest without passing the level of a year ago. The market
may "run away," but it has not yet done so.</p></div>

with survival is very wide. Moreover, "adaptation" is not a simple
matter of adjustment to the physiographic environment. It includes adjustment
to the <i>social values</i>, both of the group in question and of other
groups.</p></div>

out that his contrast between statics and dynamics is not by any means a
fixed one, and that in particular he shifts back and forth between a hypothetical
static state, primarily a methodological device, which assumes
perfect fluidity and mobility of the objects of exchange, on the one hand, and
a realistic static state, immobile, held in the bonds of custom and tradition,
illustrated by India and China, on the other hand. The version of the
distinction between statics and dynamics here discussed is only one of several
which he gives. It is, however, the one which at present I wish to contrast
with my own view. With many of Schumpeter's doctrines I am in hearty
accord, and I have learned much from his book. I think that his book affords
abundant evidence of the usefulness of the static-dynamic contrast.</p></div>

closely parallel to Veblen's contrast between the theory of wealth and

Schumpeter's optimism and Veblen's pessimism, and despite temperamental
and methodological differences. Most of my criticisms of Veblen
